P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,over,I just said to myself
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,I 've got to give it a try,I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I do n't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,I 've got to give it a try that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I do n't think I thought I would make it,And I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,there was a good accountancy career ahead of me The Dubs were actually going so well at the time,I 'd
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,You I think,I was about seventeen years
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,that that 's,I wanted to go away to Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,But you know,you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Well that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I said I could n't do it And the good thing about two or three days is they ca n't see all your faults in two or three days
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I could n't do it So I said I 'll tell you what , you 've got two or three days",the good thing about two or three days is they ca n't see all your faults in two or three days
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,So,Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I could n't do it,"I said I 'll tell you what , you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they ca n't see all your faults in two or three days"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,Well that they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and And,I went over for the trial
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,after,that helped enormously and then,that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,it was kind of like a very young team,that but very
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,you know,I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,"Oh , you 'd be lucky","you 're talking about one , two"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,have as well,you were watching that particular game
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,So you came back over,it was kind of a secret at first
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"because when I went over uhm I did n't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over , take in the trial for two or three days , come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start , continue playing with Dublin",nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as,"because just to , , come back and as far","I was concerned I was going to start , continue playing with Dublin"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,It was,"when I went over uhm I did n't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over , take in the trial for two or three days , come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start , continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know"

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,That 's right That 's right sent over all those Irish players then at the time,"I remember uhm it was based on his word really that I think Dave Sexton turned around and went , that 'll do he 'll do for us"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,as if I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm,actually when I look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,And rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career,you go around Ireland
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs,when am I going to come back for the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,I 'd still get more people,am I going to come back for the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as,I intended,you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Because,I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but as you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on,I think I always wanted to come back for the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,to come back for the Dubs uhm,as you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,coming into the team,you were All-Ireland champions
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say , early seventy-six probably you know","I remember I was resting I said I was injured but , we usually took breaks in those days during the winter But I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know"

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,I know,I could n't catch balls then
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,"I know because I could n't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I I I , fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh",I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,whereas,UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round,most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time and,"he 'd an old donkey jacket on him , a Honda fifty he 'd"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him , a Honda fifty",he 'd
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,though,And you were a fairly close-knit team,Jimmy were n't you I mean there were n't many newcomers coming into that team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as soon as,He got straight stuck into into the training,he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,I think in two All-Irelands at that stage,we were all fairly seasoned footballers
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage , and we were all fairly seasoned footballers",like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,"we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage , and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training",like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"Hanahoe , and myself to get on with the training",like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day But I think it 's something we all appreciated He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,"Hanahoe , and myself to get on with the training like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day",and I think it 's something we all appreciated He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it We enjoyed the games We won some,"we lost some But I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads , and vice versa with them"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it We enjoyed the games We won some we lost some,"and I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads , and vice versa with them"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,"remember that never a miss been uh , reshown so often I mean you missed it",it 's they keep reshowing it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match,you had n't
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,It probably would 've been one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked,he screwed her off a wee bit You know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,It probably would 've been one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it,he drop-kicked and he screwed her off a wee bit You know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,If,'ve he would 've buried it but and,he 'd kicked it normally he would
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,Yeah,at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less,you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,No there was a game They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that,which team was it The first team or the reserves
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,"I always remember the skill factor in them was , amazed me you know because I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were",how many of those other fellas made it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,Mm,You know his word was that well respected by Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it it 's only like two or three years really,"when you go around Ireland , rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,Yeah,who 's a big soccer fan as well Hello Mike
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,Yeah,uh I remember that now I played mid-field I think
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,And uhm That,because I could n't catch balls I had to run around the place I UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,So,Yeah that 's right that 's right,the least I could have done was to run around the place
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And,"It was never a Honda fifty by the by the way It was a Honda ninety , 3 sylls You would n't know how to get onto onto one of them now",you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy were n't you I mean there were n't many newcomers coming into that team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But,That 's right yeah I know,"Des sorry but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match , if you had n't 've drop-kicked that ball"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,So,'re,"I can see that in the music , you 're you you 're more European than he was , you 've advanced Would would I be right in that"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"not it is Uhm I I think the age that , well I mean the eighties has been , has funnily enough , you know , some of my music when 't was released in America got put on the New Age rack","I was , once asked by somebody"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,but But,"'m not really but there is , there is something of the times"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,"at this 'm not mean most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible Uh uh , but but I 'm not really","but there is , there is something of the times"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,"I 'm not really Do you know I mean most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible Uh uh , but but I 'm not really But but there is , there is something of the times that","one , expresses , a time that one lives in and the time we live in now is uh , is actually a searching by all"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,"not , , some of my music And",'t was released in America
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or , beneath it or , beside it , uhm it 's a time like that",there 's a there is a lot of that I think But I do believe music
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"do that do think it 's a political statement because it 's a it 's a statement of where you are , at a particular point of time And I strongly believe that I mean , okay it 's easy to see particularly in , like nationalistic music you know",if you pick for example you mentioned O / Riada if you pick an obvious one there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,do that do it 's a political statement And,"it 's a it 's a statement of where you are , at a particular point of time if you pick for example you mentioned O / Riada if you pick an obvious one there"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,"I think , that they feel for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or , beneath it or , beside it , uhm it 's a time like that and there 's a there is a lot of that I think , of that timelessness in music right now",I do believe music
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,that And you mentioned O / Riada if you pick an obvious one there,you pick for example
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,that And you mentioned O / Riada,you pick an obvious one there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,If,absolutely agree,it were just the music on its own
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,That 's right,it 's uh that particular kind
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,also,You you,it 's about Ireland
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,Well it is about Ireland,"you know it 's the time The time is you we we can not uh afford , to relax into that comfortable feeling of culture and nationalism anymore"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"I would feel part of a generation , which was uh at the uh , at the cutting edge",certainly we were the first ones to bang into the wall of the problem of globalisation and global culture
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,should you that that concept of the human family as a as a global family Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I do n't know I do n't think it need be thrown out,"it 's a kind of a post-nationalism , in a way , that 's the way I would describe it"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,so,at least,it seems to me
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,said that uh,he heard
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"And that was a bit mean But , there is an Irishness","the Irishness for me in the music , piano music I play is like an anchor , a vital anchor"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,do to leave go of it if,"I feel I do , in the context of this globalisation , well I 'm out to sea"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,So,no of where,I do
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"you , uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni / Dho/mhnaill 's for instance Uh Oilea/n ` se / mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire My body , is an island in the midst of a vast sea","uh , a lot of your music seems to be , have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition And it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"And uh , a lot of your music seems to be , have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition",it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"you , uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni / Dho/mhnaill 's for instance Uh Oilea/n ` se / mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire My body , is an island in the midst of a vast sea uh , a lot of your music seems to be , have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition",And And there 's a melancholia uh going through
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,also,about,And that There 's a nostalgic thing There 's a feeling of and you want to be there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,You know that combination of the two,"that , there 's a , uh a melancholic thing about that There 's also a nostalgic thing There 's a feeling of , being somewhere other than where you should be"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"uhm , that uhm one of , the human being 's most pleasant feelings , is the one of sweet sadness You know that combination of the two And that , there 's a , uh a melancholic thing about that There 's also a nostalgic thing There 's a feeling of , being somewhere other than where you should be",you want to be there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"And uaigneas , is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear , even in certain players playing fast music , a reel which is supposed to be joyous","it 's tinged in some way or other , with this colour of uaigneas"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,I mean there was a passionate and spiritual man you know,"his music is just uh shot through with with spirit , in a most wonderful way"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,uhm,not necessarily in an institutionalised sense Uhm
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,So,would that would that could n't,yes I am religious In that sense I suppose I 'm very religious
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,when where the fly you see,"if there is spirit in it and you , there 's , one thing you ca n't sell it 's that of course even if you know it 's there"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,"when where because there 's , one thing you ca n't sell it 's that of course even if you know it 's there",there is spirit in it and you
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,when where because n't it 's that of course,you know it 's there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,you know,you really come up against it
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,It 's,"you bring art into the marketplace You know that 's where the sparks fly you see , because if there is spirit in it and you , there 's , one thing you ca n't sell it 's that of course even if you know it 's there"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,why I 'm saying it,in a way I 'm speaking to some degree from experience Luckily
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,if you begin to do that,I have my toes
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,which would obviously come up,you begin to do that But I have my toes
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single As it is it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra deliberately which is potentially popular,"some of the music I would write or work out , on the keyboard or otherwise , happens to be in the realms of popularity You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it , uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound I have friends who , who work , exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible , for , you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless , 4 sylls Like"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,otherwise,"Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single As it is it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra yeah it has it has it it does You know I do n't deliberately write music which is potentially popular , but some of the music I would write or or or work out , on the keyboard","But or happens to be in the realms of popularity You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it , uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound I have friends who , who work , exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible , for , you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless , 4 sylls Like"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry , in particular , who is a Clare man",who lives in Dublin and who wrote
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,and who lives in Dublin,who wrote
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,And uh he 's a friend of mine,he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,But I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it,"what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular I mean let me tell you that these are not popular , under any circumstances"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,or,"Any any marketplace You , know in that sense no tunes",you know uhm no
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,what in as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality,"to me music is , a sound And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you , you see"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"I am , what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality And to me music is , a sound that you send out a bit like a scout , to check , the ground , and to clear the overgrowth","then you enter into the space And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you , you see"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"I 'm striving to go yes I 'm , no not so much beyond I I would I am , what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality And to me music is , a sound that you send out a bit like a scout , to check , the ground , and to clear the overgrowth , and then you enter into the space It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me","there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you , you see"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,then,"'m striving to go I am , what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality And to me music is , a sound that you send out a bit like a scout , to check , the ground , and to clear the overgrowth","and you enter into the space And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you , you see"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,"that that he does n't quite know what he 's going to , do He hopes , that he , starts off very simply","he starts off , with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,Mm,"if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them , or for some reason or another"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,Yeah,"I 'm you know like , uh"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,Mm,"I think rather than resisting this , uhm I think we should help it along I think we should actively , seek , uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I do n't know I do n't think it need be thrown out but it 's a kind of a post-nationalism , in a way , that 's the way I would describe it"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"Absolutely and the piano of course is a very cosmopolitan , suave instrument you know","to play it with uh , to play Irish music on it , you know it 's a bit like , you know playing it with wellingtons on or something , do you know"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"I remember a reviewer once in a UK magazine , uh said that uh when he heard the record I had done said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano","that was a bit mean But , there is an Irishness and the Irishness for me in the music , piano music I play is like an anchor , a vital anchor"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,"I remember a reviewer once in a UK magazine , uh said that uh when he heard the record I had done said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano","And that was a bit mean there is an Irishness and the Irishness for me in the music , piano music I play is like an anchor , a vital anchor"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,Mm Yeah,all of that kind of feeling Music is a wonderful way of of expressing that
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,Mm,"uaigneas , is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear , even in certain players playing fast music , a reel which is supposed to be joyous , but it 's tinged in some way or other , with this colour of uaigneas"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,It 's just unsaleable,Yeah you 've brought it into the marketplace
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,"Yes and uh some of your stuff it seems to me even 3 sylls is , uh you could sell that as a single","Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single As it is it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra yeah it has it has it it does You know I do n't deliberately write music which is potentially popular , but some of the music I would write or or or work out , on the keyboard or otherwise , happens to be in the realms of popularity You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it , uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound I have friends who , who work , exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible , for , you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless , 4 sylls Like"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"Well I 'm I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry , in particular , who is a Clare man and who lives in Dublin and who wrote , spent ten years of his life writing an opera , called The Intelligence Park which got its premiere in London and Dublin , this summer","uh he 's a friend of mine and , he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,And,"And uh he 's a friend of mine and , he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to","I think it 's extremely complex music I I could n't ask , most of my friends to listen to it You know"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,But,I know they would have a huge problem,"I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular I mean let me tell you that these are not popular , under any circumstances"
P1B-046_Elections,while,Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers,Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition
P1B-046_Elections,if,I first asked her,her description of a bright red rainbow of ruin was a bit over the top
P1B-046_Elections,and,"I do n't believe it is I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party , it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party","I see very little evidence , of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years"
P1B-046_Elections,if,"I think , it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party and",you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party
P1B-046_Elections,if,now have control over just about twenty percent of the spending departments,"you just take the allocation of portfolios for example , uh Fine Gael"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Northern Ireland policy , they 've control over broadcasting",they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum
P1B-046_Elections,and,"I think , the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government",it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment
P1B-046_Elections,If,it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept,you take the attitude to state enterprise
P1B-046_Elections,And,"Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme , and in the composition of the cabinet",as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending
P1B-046_Elections,as,"Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme , and in the composition of the cabinet And Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending",I said
P1B-046_Elections,and,This is the first inter-party government for for forty years,"we 're talking about personal , personal relationships being very very important Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"This is the first inter-party government for for forty years and we 're talking about personal , personal relationships being very very important How do you think Dick Spring",Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on
P1B-046_Elections,or,"I think it will , be a question of whether",not trust can be established between the three party leaders
P1B-046_Elections,so,"Prionsias De Rossa and John Bruton have worked well in opposition , uh",I do n't see that as a problem
P1B-046_Elections,but,"will wo n't , you can have a lot of progressive legislation",if the trust is not there from the start
P1B-046_Elections,and,from the programme for government it 's clear the government do n't understand that,they seem to want to avoid dealing with that but
P1B-046_Elections,as,but it 's often the unexpected the things you ca n't see now,I said earlier
P1B-046_Elections,because,And that 's not on the programme for government but,"of the amount of fudge on , crucial issues , local charges , and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely"
P1B-046_Elections,also,the European Commissioner,the position of and the Leas Ceann Comhairle
P1B-046_Elections,because,I supported the nominee of Fine Gael in the last occasion,I think it 's important that the opposition has that position Until recent years the opposition always had that position
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly , he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion",he 's been very fair to all sides
P1B-046_Elections,and,if be if they 're not doing the job,"he certainly is doing the job and does And I hope that the government wo n't proceed with that And certainly , if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats"

P1B-046_Elections,if,"And , uhm being removed from that position And I hope that the government wo n't proceed with that And certainly they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats",they do
P1B-046_Elections,And,"I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il did n't support Peter Sutherland , earlier this year because if they did , he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage","that would 've been a very prestigious position , for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission"
P1B-046_Elections,because,"for that did n't Peter Sutherland , earlier this year And","if they did , he would 've been I"
P1B-046_Elections,if,for that did n't because he would 've been I And,they did

P1B-046_Elections,and,And I do n't know if they could be certain of that,I think they need to be very careful It 's not a question of putting in our own
P1B-046_Elections,but,would by,I thought the experience certainly was an interesting one I. I 've said to people

P1B-046_Elections,And,And,do need a North South dimension to any settlement
P1B-046_Elections,And,"it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult , when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds I believe",the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging
P1B-046_Elections,if,it going to cause big problems for John Bruton,the architect of the process is standing behind at him shouting from the sidelines uh
P1B-046_Elections,if,to destroy the process,he continues speaking like this
P1B-046_Elections,and,because I 've given my assurance,"that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support , what they do"
P1B-046_Elections,because,This is a period of uncertainty,"we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts I 've given my assurance and that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support , what they do"
P1B-046_Elections,but,be on,"joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader , and the new Minister for Social Welfare Prionsias de Rossa First of all , congratulations on your new appointment It 's uh it 's a high-spending department"

P1B-046_Elections,But,Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers while Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition,how long will that state of affairs continue
P1B-046_Elections,for example,"I do n't believe it is I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party , it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party and I see very little evidence , of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years",Uh if you just take the allocation of portfolios uh Fine Gael now have control over just about twenty percent of the spending departments

P1B-046_Elections,And,"Well as we saw at the break of the last government , obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems",I think that may well be the case with this government too

P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,Indeed,Michael Collins and The Making of a New Ireland by Pearse Be/aslai / Michael Collins is somebody had a very profound impact on your life and on your work as a historian,and so had Pearse Be/aslai / Uhm
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,And,"I 'd heard a lot about Collins from older colleagues of my father 's notably David Nelligan and other people over the years Mickey Rooney , the former editor of The Independent told me about uhm , this extraordinary episode when uh he was called to the governor 's uh wing in uh Crumlin Road Gaol where he was imprisoned And of course the division the , the Civil War was on , the division 'd occurred there too , and he was uhm , brought in by the governor to be told something And the news was that Collins had been shot So he came back out onto the uh gangplank or onto the , iron , staircase whatever it was , and uh he began to announce this to his people , and he was interrupted by the sound of the rosary They all went down simultaneously on their knees , both Free Staters and uh , uh Republicans in Crumlin Road Gaol And the same thing , the same story or a variation of it was told by Tom Barry , so he had that sort of mesmeric effect But uh that particular volume you see there those two , it 's a famous edition","I first came across it when I was uh writing my first book Ireland Since the Rising back in nineteen sixty-five And I 'd left the Evening Press uh , we started early and you finished about four in the afternoon , and sometime of that , order I went up to the National Library , uh got these out , uh on my reading list , and settled in to read them And I meant to get uh go , break and have a cup a cup of tea And uh I was touched on the the shoulder , by this stage I was nearly through the first of the big books , by one of the attendants whom I knew And I said oh thanks very much I I meant to go out and get my tea I , thanks very much Keep an eye on them I 'll be back He said you will not We 're closing It 's ten o'clock"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,And,I was completely absorbed and then I wanted to buy the books myself They were very hard to get,"the late Tom Kenny , it was a great uh bookshop as you know in Galway , great great book family And Maureen I 'm happy to say is still with us , the wife But he looked out for them and he got them for me for ten pounds People used to say Kenny 's are very dear He got those two for me for ten pounds"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,And,"And the late Tom Kenny , it was a great uh bookshop as you know in Galway , great great book family And Maureen I 'm happy to say is still with us , the wife But he looked out for them and he got them for me for ten pounds People used to say Kenny 's are very dear He got those two for me for ten pounds","I think they 're , well you 'd pay according to the catalogues well in excess of a hundred now for that edition anywhere"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,also,The Love Poems of Yeats,I 've always been interested in uh and uh it 's kind of a long story Uh you see here uhm Nothing Happens in Carmincross by Ben Kiely Uh now I. I uh again it was under the auspice of Kenny 's if not mistaken happened that night I can tell you
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,But,"Oh yes uh , yes well I I I 've always been interested in uh , in Yeats of course Uhm , and uh it 's kind of a long story Uh you also see here uhm Nothing Happens in Carmincross by Ben Kiely Uh now I. I uh , launched that for Ben in , again it was under the auspice of Kenny 's if not mistaken , uh uh in Galway And uhm , as I said at the time Nothing Happens in Carmincross , what a misnomer , quite a lot happens Well quite a lot happened that night I can tell you , as a result","I also uh went along then to the uhm , the launch of the paperback a year later where I uh met a uh my friend"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,And,Gerry Jeffares whom I had n't met though I 'd admired him from a distance introduced him to me,"uh he rekindled my interest in Yeats because I thought that his uhm , that edition he did the collected edition he did for Macmillan was about the best introduction anybody could have to Yeats Not alone did he 've a good selection , for anybody but his uh notes at the back uh , a lot of people do n't read a book in the totality but uh because they 're just dry small print , but he had marvellously illuminating notes , everything from the pronunciation of words , to the local typography , to bits of history , to who the characters were I thought it was a model book"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,And,"And uh he rekindled my interest in Yeats because I thought that his uhm , that edition he did the collected edition he did for Macmillan was about the best introduction anybody could have to Yeats Not alone did he 've a good selection , for anybody but his uh notes at the back uh , a lot of people do n't read a book in the totality but uh because they 're just dry small print , but he had marvellously illuminating notes , everything from the pronunciation of words , to the local typography , to bits of history , to who the characters were I thought it was a model book","uhm , it just it happens to be one of the the model poems if you like"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,also,"Well uh Seamus of course is is a wonderful man He 's a wonderful poet Uh , he writes about things uh that we we sort of can identify with But uh apart from that he uhm , he is uhm , blessed with his personality He he 's a very pleasant man and uh very enabling man He gives his time very generously , and he 's no poseur","He 's a very lucky man I think in a sense that , apart from the fact he he 's a lovely wife , uh"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,then,"Derry and the the , remember that terrible shooting in Derry the Bloody Sunday","Paras thirteen the wall said Bogside nil And uhm , the other thing was that of course there was great hatred of anybody who had seemed to give aid or support to the troops And this man uh did n't uhm , uh , he he would n't sort of give in to the threats to stay home It 's just the the other side the Seamus 's insight into both senses who defied his own people to go out , but he would not be held at home by his own crowd remorse fused with terror , in his still knowable face His cornered out-face stare , blinding in the flash It is just , he he 's a man of considerable insight in other words"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,also,I. I would certainly commend him to the the younger school,"He 's kept alive , that endangered species the radio essay Has n't he"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,also,"He 's the he 's the uhm , the transatlantic equivalent of Ben because Ben goes in a circumlocutory way all around the Lagan Valley , and he finally comes back to closing time in Mulligan 's where the anecdote began And he also remembers the punchline And of course he also has a wonderful radio voice","And he 's a a was a very fine journalist and is a very fine writer A man you knew well in your Irish Press days was Brendan Behan and you have his complete plays here , uh introduced by Alan Simpson"

P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,then,"Herald Tribune saying to me that uh procession was perfectly spot-on and should be said , namely that it was n't an Irish festival , that it was uh a show of strength for the",Ancient Order of Hibernians that 's what Judith felt And uh she said paused
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me , kind of like a drug dealer",then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,so,and then they 'll need me,I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,"My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me , kind of like a drug dealer",and they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share , everybody has their own room",you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years
P1A-100_Trinity_students,because,than getting a flat,for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"Uh like they , you sort of have like a bedroom","it 's okay and there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"Uh so it 's , like they , you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay","there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,so,Uh,"and there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,It looks pretty good it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself,"you can kind of , and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"It looks pretty good , which you want to do",and and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,You kind of apply for it,it 's kind of first come first served so
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,so hopefully just the three people are alright,they 're not
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if,well that 's,I get in at all
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it they do sometimes like if you got , like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who , like she was a student there","but she was over from Ireland And like they wanted As in like , biology and chemistry and maths or something , and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she , they let her in anyway"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it but , they do sometimes like if you got , like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who , like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland And like they wanted As in like , biology and chemistry and maths or something","she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she , they let her in anyway"

P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed",then the result came back worse
P1A-100_Trinity_students,But,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed",and then the result came back worse
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people,they upgraded a few thousand I think so
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,That 's horrible,they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,that 'd fear contesting I 'd just be like,"they 'd go back over it with a , even more so , cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like , what , five minutes or something like that"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,when,But I they go back over it extra marks they can give,you appeal it looking for
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again,then it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if,It 's like clown music It 's awful they put you on hold again And,you ask to be put up to the contact lens department
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,It 's like clown music It 's awful,And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_Trinity_students,although,No but No but so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well,I 've never had to ring them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,Yeah they might And in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves,it was really slow and depressing and horrible
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,I ca n't remember why we were going up the lift,we went up the lift I was
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,we were going up to the second floor,we were down in the basement and we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,I think it 's cos we were going up to the second floor and we were down in the basement,we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,so,we were just walking by the lifts,and it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there,"there 's , there 's something I was going to say I ca n't remember now"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if,"Yeah , well you never know",I remember it
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,I think it was something about lifts,"I ca n't think of it , what it was now"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,when,"yeah , now see once",I was in a lift
P1A-100_Trinity_students,while,And he opened the doors,the lift was going down
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier,"he did that like , and he was just like , oh look at this"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier he did that like,"and he was just like , oh look at this"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"And , the lift stopped","it was just like , then the thing it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like , and he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,And and we 're stuck Oh my God and,it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"And it was just like , then the thing , the lift stopped and it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like",he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,Then the thing started going again,it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,Then,only,the thing started going again and
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,like I usually I do n't mind small confined spaces,if I was going to be stuck there
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if,cos,I was going to be stuck there
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift,"they start drinking coffee I mean would n't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift , like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,when,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift and would that you could do,"you were stuck in a lift , like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,because,why it could n't have been because of his laziness,you 're just as lazy So I did n't know what it was
P1A-100_Trinity_students,Or,Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter I mean it could n't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy So I did n't know what it was,just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho
P1A-100_Trinity_students,So,why could n't have because,I did n't know what it was
P1A-100_Trinity_students,also,that,that annoys
P1A-100_Trinity_students,instead,you,like wearing Escape for women
P1A-100_Trinity_students,Or,Yeah That would n't be nice at all really,how about Emporio for women Is that nice
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,I 've smelled Emporio for women,it 's not very nice
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if then,you appealed and,the result came back worse
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,"Uh it 's fairly good , it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share , everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years",You pay every year
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,"Yeah And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat , because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year","I think you share a kitchen with three other people , which is the least anywhere else would have you Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,But,Oh right,"like you can , you have both options there anyway so"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,One of my study incentives,"then is it like , are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,One of my study incentives,"And is it like , are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,so,"Uhm , some of them are ensuite You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served so , fingers crossed for me",Fingers crossed Yeah so hopefully just the three people are alright and they 're not
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,Exactly,Cos like with eleven people you 'd be assured to have a few good people there but three people you 're just
P1A-100_Trinity_students,But,You did n't sit my exams,you 're Judith You 're smart
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,But you 're Judith You 're smart,Yeah it was hard
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,Mm,"you need what , you need one A and four Bs"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,But,Yeah Hopefully Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I do n't like,"sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,It 's like clown music It 's awful And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched,"every few seconds it 's interrupted by , welcome to Specsavers Your call is important to us"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,"No but No but although I 've never had to ring them , so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well",Yeah they might in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves and it was really slow and depressing and horrible
P1A-100_Trinity_students,though,Not all lifts Actually I do n't think I 've ever been in a lift that had lift music,One thing I hate talking lifts I hate them
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,Mhm,while the lift was going down he opened the doors
P1A-100_Trinity_students,And,Ah That 's like something my brother would do,"it was just like , then the thing , the lift stopped and it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like , and he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,But,What an idiot,"he was only pretending he closed the doors , so Then the thing started going again and it was just like , you fucking bastard"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,And,"'d he had brought , the , one of the fellas back to stay in Mike 's house",Mike was saying oh
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,And you know the guards,"I mean him going out and buying it He 'd be stupid enough to get caught So he was not at all amused , so I was glad of that"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,So,And going out and,he was not at all amused
P1A-097_Sisters_2,so,And and I mean him going out and buying it He 'd be stupid enough to get caught So he was not at all amused,you know the guards I was glad of that
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,Mm mm Yeah yeah,"who said that he would n't , he would n't mind"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,And,Yeah it 's a different kind of scene to the the drink you know,I do n't think he
P1A-097_Sisters_2,when,it 's too dangerous,you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"Oh it 's absolutely frightening absolutely , 2 sylls life You know",it 's starting he started on cough bottles kind of you know

P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,And Ben said something and he,"he turned round and said I was n't speaking to you , in this tone And I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I was n't speaking to you"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,And,"And Ben said something and he , and he turned round and said I was n't speaking to you , in this tone",I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I was n't speaking to you

P1A-097_Sisters_2,And,Yeah Yeah yeah,also I mean in the cold everybody eats more You have to
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,What,it comes to looking at memory
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And,"But that must be an extremely difficult thing to do I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around , the Catholic story and the Protestant story",you talk about prophetic voice Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"that 's our vision We want , to to maintain the link with Britain",we want to maintain our Protestant ethos
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,But the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh,"you walked through the areas of uh uh Loyalist Belfast you 'll see that men will take up the gun to fight for God and Ulster They 'll say that 's our vision We want , to to maintain the link with Britain and we want to maintain our Protestant ethos We want , to regenerate that ethos with each new generation"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,also,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it , it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision",this is true of the any vision that is left in uh
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,to play that the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism,they have their vision of a united Ireland
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"So are you actually saying uh in a sense that uh the stories , the two stories one Protestant the other Catholic Nationalist one Protestant Loyalist , they 're actually crumbling They 're crumbling now in front of a world which is changing rapidly",the ideologues of both camps are n't prepared to accept that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,whether that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland,"in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists , are no longer dominant in any real sense because they do n't have any , uh they do n't have any control over , political power It 's it 's direct rule from Westminster They feel that there is a a democratic deficit They are in the process of creating a new story A new story which evolves around , look we 're victims too"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,whether functional today in Northern Ireland because the dominant group are no longer dominant in any real sense,they do n't have any
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,whose usefulness to their masters that should and because you 've got to dominate people over That 's finished That story is finished They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and and,"and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people , on this side of the border to be magnanimous , Northern Protestant people at the moment"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,whose usefulness to their masters And it is after all the duty of garrison people among uh,"they have been , that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you do n't try to win them over as friends Now their usefulness , in terms of the old imperial structures , is over That 's finished That story is finished They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people , on this side of the border to be magnanimous , and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly Northern Protestant people at the moment"

P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,When,would challenge to rediscover their identity as a community church,I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And,One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities,uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if then,"we may put it like that without offensiveness is over And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have , by and large been , that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them","you do n't try to win them over as friends Now their usefulness , in terms of the old imperial structures , is over That 's finished That story is finished They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people , on this side of the border to be magnanimous , and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly , uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment So I take your point entirely"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,But,"Yes ah yes Well I I think it is that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination , and that 's its purpose I you see I do n't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell , it 's the use to which they put the story And the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one Though I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who do n't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those And that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say , let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another They were constructed precisely in order not to live with one another and they were constructed precisely in order to have one group dominate over another Now uh what I have suggested in the book is that you have to try and transcend , these two It 's not a question of giving them uh equal respect , as is often said by well-meaning people , but rather to try and transcend these two uh mutually exclusive ideologies","that must be an extremely difficult thing to do I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around , the Catholic story and the Protestant story And you talk about prophetic voice Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,in fact,"But that must be an extremely difficult thing to do I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around , the Catholic story and the Protestant story And you talk about prophetic voice Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that","Yeah I I I I 'm not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that , uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features , but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous , light uh after the collapse of Stalinism , uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this We know how dangerous that is But at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland I think of recent generations is uh two uh ideologies which are pretending to a future end that they do n't actually believe in any more There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer , uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism And I I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be , for us all together , uh but has simply continued to mouth , ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which wo n't do it for us"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,But,"Yeah I I I I 'm not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that , uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features , but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous , light uh after the collapse of Stalinism , uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this We know how dangerous that is But at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland I think of recent generations is uh two uh ideologies which are pretending to a future end that they do n't actually believe in any more There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer , uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism And I I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be , for us all together , uh but has simply continued to mouth , ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which wo n't do it for us","the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously For example if you walked through the areas of uh uh Loyalist Belfast you 'll see that men will take up the gun to fight for God and Ulster They 'll say that 's our vision We want , to to maintain the link with Britain and we want to maintain our Protestant ethos We want , to regenerate that ethos with each new generation"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"But the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously For example if you walked through the areas of uh uh Loyalist Belfast you 'll see that men will take up the gun to fight for God and Ulster They 'll say that 's our vision We want , to to maintain the link with Britain and we want to maintain our Protestant ethos We want , to regenerate that ethos with each new generation",Yeah it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision And uhm Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,But,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it , it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision And uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive","has Catholic Nationalism any part to play for example in the struggle that is taking place in Northern Ireland today I mean what , uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism when they have their vision of a united Ireland"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And,"Yes yes I I I actually tried to talk about that in in this book right that it it must be taken uh uh on board by people particularly the establishment let us say in Dublin , uh that the Unionist people , are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have , by and large been , that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you do n't try to win them over as friends Now their usefulness , in terms of the old imperial structures , is over That 's finished That story is finished They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people , on this side of the border to be magnanimous , and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly , uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment So I take your point entirely",that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill and Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine As we pointed out at the beginning of the programme the Methodist Conference is currently meeting in Dublin One of the issues discussed on Friday concerned the role of Methodist societies in the local community The conference would like to challenge Methodists throughout Northern Ireland to rediscover their identity as a community church When I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,And,hear We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations,as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,we a response from the Churches we,the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,And,"the theme the incoming Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland , the Reverend Dr Andrew Rodgers has chosen for his year in office Last Monday evening Dr Rodgers was installed at a service at Church House in Belfast where he succeeded the Very Reverend Dr John Dunlop During his term of office the new Moderator intends to lead a personal crusade , to make the Christian message more apparent in society here",that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly First though did he feel that a useful asset for any moderator at general assembly was a sense of humour
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,that the main area of discussion,I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly First though did he feel that a useful asset for any moderator at general assembly was a sense of humour
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"whenever whether in session committee or any other , meeting that if you can inject a little humour , without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off","perhaps it does help to to to bring a a a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I suppose blessed with a warped sense of humour or cursed with it whatever way you like to put it , that leaves me that I 've got to be a little bit careful in case"

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,moral programme as God lays it out for us I do n't want to be seen to be censoring people God leaves out for us clear rules for good wholesome living he redeemed us by his son and here 's the way to live That 's what he 's saying,"I 'm trying to point the Church and the people that they will I hope uh in some way or other influence back to the basic principles of good wholesome living , not a a a censorious business at all but rather here 's the right way to live God made us , and that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to"

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,And,and,'s just a sad business if they do because it 's not It 's the gathering of God 's people together it 's a matter of them going out with the message that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God and that as the result of it being

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,"Do that perhaps some of the language that you used , might have been seen",perhaps a little insensitive I 'm thinking about your reference to gay and saying that that was an inept euphemism It 's a way they like to describe themselves
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,And,that that as that that Now I want to make it very clear that I did not condemn homosexuals Not at all I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God,that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,that that as that that that we as a church,this is what I was trying to do
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,that that are uh,"you have mentioned that may be unhappy My problem with the word gay is that I always associated in the past gay with a a happy note , a a pleasant note For and this to attach that word to what is after all something that a tendency that they 've been born with which is not happy , to me is very sad Now I want to make it very clear that I did not condemn homosexuals Not at all I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God And that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do"

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"morning the media crowded into the launch of a citizen s ' enquiry , the Opsahl Commission 's Report on Northern Ireland The result of over five hundred and fifty submissions from various church and secular groups , whose main concern was to find a solution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland From the start of its deliberation the Opsahl Commission had a difficult task MP Ken Maginnis dismissed it The Northern Catholic Bishops failed to make a contribution","some Republican community activists were suspicious of making a submission for fear of being politically vetted Apart from the SDLP who preferred to study the documents before giving a considered opinion , the other parties were clear about how they felt"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,before,to study the documents,"giving a considered opinion , the other parties were clear about how they felt"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,If then,"you 've got a if you 're a mother and you 're single parent , and you you have n't got enough money well",of course you 've got to feed your child You might go in to Woolworth 's and lift something
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,Also,"In the wake of the publication of the Opsahl Commission report we hear a response from the Churches We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations And as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values , we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right",on the programme we join pilgrims going to the island of Inishmacsaint in County Fermanagh Morning service at half past ten comes from Gilnahirk Presbyterian Church in Belfast

P1A-100_College_plans,and,"My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me , kind of like a drug dealer",then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_College_plans,so,and then they 'll need me,I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_College_plans,then,"My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me , kind of like a drug dealer",and they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share , everybody has their own room",you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years
P1A-100_College_plans,because,than getting a flat,for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"Uh like they , you sort of have like a bedroom","it 's okay and there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"Uh so it 's , like they , you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay","there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_College_plans,so,Uh,"and there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,It looks pretty good it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself,"you can kind of , and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"It looks pretty good , which you want to do",and and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term
P1A-100_College_plans,and,You kind of apply for it,it 's kind of first come first served so
P1A-100_College_plans,and,so hopefully just the three people are alright,they 're not
P1A-100_College_plans,if,well that 's,I get in at all
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it they do sometimes like if you got , like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who , like she was a student there","but she was over from Ireland And like they wanted As in like , biology and chemistry and maths or something , and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she , they let her in anyway"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it but , they do sometimes like if you got , like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who , like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland And like they wanted As in like , biology and chemistry and maths or something","she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she , they let her in anyway"
P1A-100_College_plans,if,Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it like and,"you got , like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who , like she was a student there"
P1A-100_College_plans,so,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it but , and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else","and she , they let her in anyway"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed",then the result came back worse
P1A-100_College_plans,But,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed",and then the result came back worse
P1A-100_College_plans,and,That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people,they upgraded a few thousand I think so
P1A-100_College_plans,but,That 's horrible,they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so
P1A-100_College_plans,and,that 'd fear contesting I 'd just be like,"they 'd go back over it with a , even more so , cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like , what , five minutes or something like that"
P1A-100_College_plans,when,But I they go back over it extra marks they can give,you appeal it looking for
P1A-100_College_plans,And,And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again,then it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_College_plans,if,It 's like clown music It 's awful they put you on hold again And,you ask to be put up to the contact lens department
P1A-100_College_plans,then,It 's like clown music It 's awful,And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_College_plans,although,No but No but so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well,I 've never had to ring them
P1A-100_College_plans,and,Yeah they might And in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves,it was really slow and depressing and horrible
P1A-100_College_plans,but,I ca n't remember why we were going up the lift,we went up the lift I was
P1A-100_College_plans,and,we were going up to the second floor,we were down in the basement and we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like
P1A-100_College_plans,and,I think it 's cos we were going up to the second floor and we were down in the basement,we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like
P1A-100_College_plans,so,we were just walking by the lifts,and it was just like
P1A-100_College_plans,and,Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there,"there 's , there 's something I was going to say I ca n't remember now"
P1A-100_College_plans,if,"Yeah , well you never know",I remember it
P1A-100_College_plans,but,I think it was something about lifts,"I ca n't think of it , what it was now"
P1A-100_College_plans,when,"yeah , now see once",I was in a lift
P1A-100_College_plans,while,And he opened the doors,the lift was going down
P1A-100_College_plans,and,in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier,"he did that like , and he was just like , oh look at this"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier he did that like,"and he was just like , oh look at this"
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"And , the lift stopped","it was just like , then the thing it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like , and he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them"
P1A-100_College_plans,And,And and we 're stuck Oh my God and,it was just like
P1A-100_College_plans,and,"And it was just like , then the thing , the lift stopped and it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like",he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them
P1A-100_College_plans,and,Then the thing started going again,it was just like
P1A-100_College_plans,Then,only,the thing started going again and
P1A-100_College_plans,but,like I usually I do n't mind small confined spaces,if I was going to be stuck there
P1A-100_College_plans,if,cos,I was going to be stuck there
P1A-100_College_plans,and,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift,"they start drinking coffee I mean would n't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift , like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
P1A-100_College_plans,when,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift and would that you could do,"you were stuck in a lift , like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
P1A-100_College_plans,because,why it could n't have been because of his laziness,you 're just as lazy So I did n't know what it was
P1A-100_College_plans,Or,Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter I mean it could n't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy So I did n't know what it was,just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho
P1A-100_College_plans,So,why could n't have because,I did n't know what it was
P1A-100_College_plans,also,that,that annoys
P1A-100_College_plans,instead,you,like wearing Escape for women
P1A-100_College_plans,Or,Yeah That would n't be nice at all really,how about Emporio for women Is that nice
P1A-100_College_plans,and,I 've smelled Emporio for women,it 's not very nice
P1A-100_College_plans,if then,you appealed and,the result came back worse
P1A-100_College_plans,then,"Uh it 's fairly good , it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share , everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years",You pay every year
P1A-100_College_plans,And,"Yeah And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat , because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year","I think you share a kitchen with three other people , which is the least anywhere else would have you Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people"
P1A-100_College_plans,But,Oh right,"like you can , you have both options there anyway so"
P1A-100_College_plans,And,One of my study incentives,"then is it like , are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
P1A-100_College_plans,then,One of my study incentives,"And is it like , are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
P1A-100_College_plans,so,"Uhm , some of them are ensuite You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served so , fingers crossed for me",Fingers crossed Yeah so hopefully just the three people are alright and they 're not
P1A-100_College_plans,then,Exactly,Cos like with eleven people you 'd be assured to have a few good people there but three people you 're just
P1A-100_College_plans,But,You did n't sit my exams,you 're Judith You 're smart
P1A-100_College_plans,but,But you 're Judith You 're smart,Yeah it was hard
P1A-100_College_plans,And,Mm,"you need what , you need one A and four Bs"
P1A-100_College_plans,But,Yeah Hopefully Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I do n't like,"sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse"
P1A-100_College_plans,And,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
P1A-100_College_plans,And,It 's like clown music It 's awful And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched,"every few seconds it 's interrupted by , welcome to Specsavers Your call is important to us"
P1A-100_College_plans,And,"No but No but although I 've never had to ring them , so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well",Yeah they might in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves and it was really slow and depressing and horrible
P1A-100_College_plans,though,Not all lifts Actually I do n't think I 've ever been in a lift that had lift music,One thing I hate talking lifts I hate them
P1A-100_College_plans,And,Mhm,while the lift was going down he opened the doors
P1A-100_College_plans,And,Ah That 's like something my brother would do,"it was just like , then the thing , the lift stopped and it was just like , oh no we 're stuck , we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like , and he was just there oh Jesus I ca n't even close them"
P1A-100_College_plans,But,What an idiot,"he was only pretending he closed the doors , so Then the thing started going again and it was just like , you fucking bastard"
P1A-099_Dresses,and,I made sandwiches,we 're having tea
P1A-099_Dresses,if,something belonging to me,you want to I do n't know if I have anything
P1A-099_Dresses,and,it 'll fit you,I 'm like no no

P1A-099_Dresses,and,like it did n't do anything for my hips It made my hips look big,like my you know
P1A-099_Dresses,then,I the dress,and I
P1A-099_Dresses,if,And 'd be grand,we can get Declan Neill and them to come on it
P1A-099_Dresses,and,it 's uhm Charles as well,that I think that 's including Fintan
P1A-099_Dresses,but,'s if,we probably wo n't be able to
P1A-099_Dresses,if,Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that I think that 's including Fintan,we can get him to come but we probably wo n't be able to
P1A-099_Dresses,but,oh we got all of ours,we did n't get yours
P1A-099_Dresses,And,Uhm I do n't even have Martin 's number now,apparently he 's turned off his phone because people keep ringing him
P1A-099_Dresses,because,he 's turned off his phone,apparently people keep ringing him
P1A-099_Dresses,if,like give them the sixty quid,you knew one of the guys who were collecting the tickets
P1A-099_Dresses,besides,And That was the last resort,I do n't want to ring Martin
P1A-099_Dresses,because,n't what to do,we 're invited to Sarah 's as well on the same night
P1A-099_Dresses,but,Well we could,then we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad We 'd be friendlier with her
P1A-099_Dresses,then,Well we could,but we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad We 'd be friendlier with her
P1A-099_Dresses,but,I 'd say we 'll end up in Declan 's I mean like that was our immediate thing,we feel a bit bad so we 'll just have to see What are you saying yeah Are you going to come to the Ball
P1A-099_Dresses,so,I 'd say we 'll end up in Declan 's I mean like that was our immediate thing a bit bad,but we 'll just have to see
