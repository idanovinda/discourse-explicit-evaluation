P1B-046_Elections,and,"northern ireland policy, they 've control over broadcasting, and they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"i think, the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government and it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet"
P1B-046_Elections,and,and that certainly doesn't indicate to me that fine gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the labour party
P1B-046_Elections,and,"this is the first inter-party government for for forty years and we 're talking about personal, personal relationships being very very important"
P1B-046_Elections,and,and i think that may well be the case with this government too
P1B-046_Elections,and,uhm and
P1B-046_Elections,and,"uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by albert reynolds trust broke down and once it did everything else collapsed"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"it 's clear the government don't understand that, and they seem to want to avoid dealing with that"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"it 's clear the government don't understand that, and they seem to want to avoid dealing with that"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"he 's been very good in the chair, and he 's been very fair to all sides"
P1B-046_Elections,and,and if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job
P1B-046_Elections,and,and if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job
P1B-046_Elections,and,and i don't know if they could be certain of that
P1B-046_Elections,and,and he expressed that concern
P1B-046_Elections,and,and if we fail uh to do that then i think we 're going to cause further problems
P1B-046_Elections,and,and i think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary
P1B-046_Elections,and,and i certainly think it 's very unfair on the new government in a period
P1B-046_Elections,and,and i hope that fianna fa/il do likewise
P1B-046_Elections,and,"well uhm i intend to make my uh mark by seeking to implement the programme which we have negotiated with the other parties in government uhm we have managed in the course of those negotiations to, negotiate one of the most significant changes in our approach to assisting, uh families uh, ever ever ever achieved and that is in relation to child, benefit there will be a new uhm, increase in child, benefit but also the uh provision of a supplementary child benefit which will uh, replace the child dependence allowance for, social welfare recipients, and uh for low paid, workers the uh f fis"
P1B-046_Elections,as,"well as we saw at the break of the last government, obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems"
P1B-046_Elections,as,it won't be even to do with financial matters it may well be to do with personality issues as well
P1B-046_Elections,as,"i found these negotiations insofar as we were involved, uhm very unpleasant"
P1B-046_Elections,so,"i think prionsias de rossa and john bruton have worked well in opposition, uh so i don't see that as a problem"
P1B-046_Elections,or,"uhm if the three party leaders don't make an enormous effort to work together as a team the government will collapse or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive certainly"
P1B-046_Elections,because,"uhm if the three party leaders don't make an enormous effort to work together as a team the government will collapse or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive certainly"
P1B-046_Elections,because,i supported the nominee of fine gael in the last occasion because i think it 's important that the opposition has that position until recent years the opposition always had that position
P1B-046_Elections,because,"i was very disappointed for example that labour and fianna fa/il didn't support peter sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been i think the president of the commission at this stage and that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours"
P1B-046_Elections,because,this is a period of uncertainty because we have a new government
P1B-046_Elections,because,"it will mean that a lot of people who, previously uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh will no longer do so"
P1B-046_Elections,once,"uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by albert reynolds trust broke down and once it did everything else collapsed"
P1B-046_Elections,therefore,"and therefore i believe that the new government if they 're going to change the commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest padraig flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person"
P1B-046_Elections,when,albert reynolds himself was very concerned just over a year ago when a very important document was leaked to a journalist
P1B-046_Elections,when,"and we do need a north south dimension to any settlement it makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like albert reynolds"
P1B-046_Elections,likewise,and i hope that fianna fa/il do likewise
P1B-046_Elections,also,"well uhm i intend to make my uh mark by seeking to implement the programme which we have negotiated with the other parties in government uhm we have managed in the course of those negotiations to, negotiate one of the most significant changes in our approach to assisting, uh families uh, ever ever ever achieved and that is in relation to child, benefit there will be a new uhm, increase in child, benefit but also the uh provision of a supplementary child benefit which will uh, replace the child dependence allowance for, social welfare recipients, and uh for low paid, workers the uh f fis"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,"many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the league of ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success kevin moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the usa with the irish world cup squad and today kevin moran is our guest in the studio"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but i just said to myself
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but i always felt i wanted to have a good go at it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,so it was kind of like a very young team and that but very
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but actually when i look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,yeah but not only rural ireland very much dublin as well
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,because i think i always wanted to come back for the dubs i always intended to come back for the dubs uhm but as you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,but

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,and i think that was the main reason why i went in the end
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,and i 'd no real interest
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,and i said i couldn't do it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,and i said i couldn't do it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,so that helped enormously and then after that dave sexton offered me the contract

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,and
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,"the uh, the move to manchester united were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time because you were"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,just play one game i always remember saying that to people all i just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as i was concerned all i wanted to do was play with the dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,"i always remember the skill factor in them was, amazed me you know because i 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what i mean how good they were"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,it was because when i went over uhm i didn't want anybody to know about it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,i know because i couldn't catch balls then i had to run around the place you see
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,you know i think when i was about seventeen years of age eighteen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,well the the thing about it is that when i went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,it was because when i went over uhm i didn't want anybody to know about it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,but actually when i look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,"and when you go around ireland, rural ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the dubs as for your whole long soccer career"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,not bad now those days uh moran coming into the team when you were all-ireland champions you wouldn't have known a lot about him
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so i said i 'll tell you what
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so that helped enormously and then after that dave sexton offered me the contract
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so it was kind of like a very young team and that but very
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so probably only you from that team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so i would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,so the least i could have done was to run around the place
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,so that helped enormously and then after that dave sexton offered me the contract
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,or,"what did you do for the two or three, just train with them or did you play a match"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,"oh, you 'd be lucky if you 're talking about one, two"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,i 'd probably have been the least likely one as well if you were watching that particular game
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,if he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,whereas,so i would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as,"i think in two all-irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,indeed and so had pearse be/aslai/ uhm
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,i 'd heard a lot about collins from older colleagues of my father 's notably david nelligan and other people over the years

P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,and i first came across it when i was uh writing my first book ireland since the rising back in nineteen sixty-five
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"and i think they 're, well you 'd pay according to the catalogues well in excess of a hundred now for that edition anywhere"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"and uhm, it just it happens to be one of the the model poems if you like"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,and i see his early volume field work here on your shelves
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,he he 's a very pleasant man and uh very enabling man
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"if you consider the reception, that his work is met and his personality is met with in this ireland, uhm compared to say the treatment of, or the kind of the expected behaviour of people like kavanagh and uh behan and myles"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"and then uhm, the other thing was that of course there was great hatred of anybody who had seemed to give aid or support to the troops"
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,as a former editor and uh long-time journalist
P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"uh he was uhm, he was always at the very best tables and uh, married an admiral 's daughter and that sort of thing uh had entree from uh very high level and in those days, well it 's still, to a large extent the style of england is the style of america but very much more so in his time"

P1B-048_Tim_Pat_Coogan,and,"and uh she said then paused, but he shouldn't 've been drunk when he said it"
