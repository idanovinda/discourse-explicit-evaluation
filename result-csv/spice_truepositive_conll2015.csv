and,P1A-100_College_plans,"My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me , kind of like a drug dealer",then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them
and,P1A-100_College_plans,"than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share , everybody has their own room",you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years
and,P1A-100_College_plans,You kind of apply for it,it 's kind of first come first served so
and,P1A-100_College_plans,so hopefully just the three people are alright,they 're not
and,P1A-100_College_plans,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
and,P1A-100_College_plans,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
and,P1A-100_College_plans,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is , imagine if you appealed",then the result came back worse
and,P1A-100_College_plans,That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people,they upgraded a few thousand I think so
and,P1A-100_College_plans,It 's like clown music It 's awful And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched,"every few seconds it 's interrupted by , welcome to Specsavers Your call is important to us"
and,P1A-100_College_plans,Yeah they might And in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves,it was really slow and depressing and horrible

and,P1A-100_College_plans,Mhm,while the lift was going down he opened the doors
and,P1A-100_College_plans,in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier,"he did that like , and he was just like , oh look at this"

and,P1A-100_College_plans,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift,"they start drinking coffee I mean would n't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift , like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
and,P1A-100_College_plans,I 've smelled Emporio for women,it 's not very nice
then,P1A-100_College_plans,It 's like clown music It 's awful,And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
then,P1A-100_College_plans,only,the thing started going again and
so,P1A-100_College_plans,and then they 'll need me,I 'll be friends with them
so,P1A-100_College_plans,Uh,"and there 's a room , like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"
because,P1A-100_College_plans,than getting a flat,for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year
but,P1A-100_College_plans,You did n't sit my exams,you 're Judith You 're smart
but,P1A-100_College_plans,That 's horrible,they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so

but,P1A-100_College_plans,I think it was something about lifts,"I ca n't think of it , what it was now"
but,P1A-100_College_plans,like I usually I do n't mind small confined spaces,if I was going to be stuck there
or,P1A-100_College_plans,Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter I mean it could n't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy So I did n't know what it was,just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho
or,P1A-100_College_plans,Yeah That would n't be nice at all really,how about Emporio for women Is that nice
if,P1A-100_College_plans,well that 's,I get in at all
if,P1A-100_College_plans,It 's like clown music It 's awful they put you on hold again And,you ask to be put up to the contact lens department
