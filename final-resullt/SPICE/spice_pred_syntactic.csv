P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,"let us say in Dublin, uh that the Unionist people, are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them"

P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,The conference would like to challenge Methodists throughout Northern Ireland to rediscover their identity as a community church When I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,"In the wake of the publication of the Opsahl Commission report we hear a response from the Churches We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations And as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values, we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,And that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly First
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,"Well have I found often Patrick that, whenever a situation gets a little bit tight whether in session committee or any other, meeting that if you can inject a little humour, without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off and perhaps it does help to to to bring a a a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,because,"And yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour, but some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship"

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,"I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God And that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do, we as a church must get alongside those who have this tendency as we must get alongside those who are, uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with or that they have eventually found within themselves and fight that tendency"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,But how can you manage to do that successfully when you 've already criticised your own Church in a sense for being more like a social club
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,so,Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God and
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,If you 've got a if you 're a mother
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,Well if if Yes I take your point that we 've got to recognise why they do this

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,because,It 's not uh confined to the poor people You can understand the reason for the poor people doing it because they are so poor but in the case of the rich sin 's still sin
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,"Yes I think you 've touched on a point that 's very valuable When people live on a farm for example, all the children are expected to gather together and help out on the farm They don't get paid for doing that It 's just part and parcel of living"
