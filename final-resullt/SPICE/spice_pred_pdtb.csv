P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation","Well uhm I applied then, uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,but,"that uh you know you had, two children, who were growing up","also you had uh, your horses and you had your other outside interests"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,I 'll apply,"if I 'm accepted, well and good"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,so,"I finished my prayers by praying for a pony, but the pony never came We weren't a very well-off family so I 'm afraid a pony 's worth, it 'd beyond our means",I just rode on other people
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,but,"My late husband was a great horseman and we used to break, in young horses and show them You know so I love showing a horse, and I love dressage",three-day eventing would be what we 're interested in mostly you know the dressage cross country and the show jumping
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf, they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with, steel or iron supports, so those hadn't been properly secured unfortunately",as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church","Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy And uhm I enjoyed doing that But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said, you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good And that 's just how I did it"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,for example,It 's hard to say Padraig really Uhm,"I think with riding, it 's just being at one with your animal, you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do And it 's very exhilarating Racing going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating, very thrilling"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,because,"it made more difficult, definitely more difficult",you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say, and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted",what had you thought to do
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"No no that was quite dormant at that stage, totally dormant I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters so on","but, entering the church had never, entered my mind, at that stage"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,then,"I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year",people said
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,if,God 's prompting,"you like but I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,then,So then what was the the next stage in your career,"Well uhm I applied uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it, and I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,but,"she 's a bit hot for the dressage a bit excitable, but good for the show jumping I think","Wren 's Hill, and out of a chasing-bred mare so she 's got a little bit of both flat and chasing blood in her, and she 's very promising as a show jumper I thought she might 've done dressage"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,that the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding I found it very thrilling,really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,It is Yes it is,it 's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away Yes it 's lovely here
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,I think she 's she 's uh telling us something,her just off the grass yes I don't know what it is
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,although,"But again you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good","I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,so,a number of young people and children coming on,"it 's very promising, for the future I think We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,It 's hard to say Padraig really Uhm,"I think with riding, it 's just being at one with your animal, you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do it 's very exhilarating Racing for example going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating, very thrilling"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and, the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding I found it very thrilling",I rode out on the race horses
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,then,"And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church","Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy And uhm I enjoyed doing that But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said, you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church And I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good And that 's just how I did it"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,also,"Well uhm I applied then, uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it, and I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation","As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've had to bear in mind that uh you know you had, two children, who were growing up but also you had uh, your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,but,you like,"I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,then,"God 's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it","And when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,when,And then,"did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,so,"That 's right yes that 's right, uhm it did Frank was killed in an accident He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry And you know how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf, they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with, steel or iron supports, so those hadn't been properly secured, and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock Took me quite a while to get over that","there you were, unexpectantly, widowed and two children to take care of"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,"No no but, eventually then I was trained I was trained by Captain Jeremy Beale who was a member of the British Olympic Team, for a couple of years I went to him then I went to Miss Iris Kellett in Dublin for many years, and in Kill in County Kildare",oh no no I wasn't No I at the beginning I rode on other people 's

P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,and,And a teacher,"a teacher, and what was it then that was, within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself evident"
P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,because,"Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted",of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say

P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,but,I 'm not going to worry,"if I don't win, as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself For me that 's the main thing"

P1A-100_Trinity_students,so,we were just walking by the lifts anyway,it was just like
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces,if I was going to be stuck there
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"You 're not meant to know it but, they do sometimes like if you got, like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who, like she was a student there",she was over from Ireland
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is, imagine if you appealed then",the result came back worse
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,"No, cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result I 'd just be like, and they 'd go back over it with a, even more so, cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like, what, five minutes or something like that","Yeah Yeah I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for, extra marks they can give you, not looking for"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do,you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term
P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,One of my study incentives,"And is it like, are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,if,that 's,I get in at all
P1A-100_Trinity_students,once,"Oh yeah, now I remember No see","when I was in a lift with my brother, we were in James 's hospital right"

P1A-100_Trinity_students,then,"Uh it 's fairly good, it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share, everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years",You pay every year
P1A-100_Trinity_students,but,Yeah Hopefully Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I don't like,"sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is, imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse"

P1A-100_Trinity_students,and,"Yeah And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat, because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year","I think you share a kitchen with three other people, which is the least anywhere else would have you Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people"
P1A-100_Trinity_students,although,No but No but so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well,I 've never had to ring them

P1A-097_Sisters_2,though,"I 've kind of believe it, it just feels like that tonight Even",the sky is very clear it just has that really cold feeling

P1A-097_Sisters_2,until,Yeah Yeah yeah,you kind of feel they have to be a bit responsible for themselves
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"about you know, he 's bad enough as he is",he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out

P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,you know you have to be careful,that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,Yeah at fourteen it 's just not on Not on,So anyway but he was like a devil yesterday Then he announced yesterday he said I 'm going into town to get my ear pierced I said you are in your bum going into town to get your ear pierced Where are you going And he said oh this place in Nemo 's Arcade And I said you have to go somewhere hygienic or you 'll get AIDS or something
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult, and cheeky and that But this kind of, look now that really makes you just boil, with rage you know","Really kind of trying it out you know I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know and he 's going to say no And then what do you do And that you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it, you know"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,when,"But uhm, he just, got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths Now and everyone is fucking freezing",you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off
P1A-097_Sisters_2,but,I see I see,real aggressive Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope And I thought I 'd like my frigging job sweetie giving you your twenty-five p And I said no you can use your own money And then he marched into
P1A-097_Sisters_2,also,Yeah Yeah yeah,And I mean in the cold everybody eats more You have to
P1A-097_Sisters_2,when,Yeah I mean it 's too dangerous,you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"Too young yeah yeah Mm, would he not be afraid of that","And Ben said something and he, and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to you, in this tone I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I wasn't speaking to you"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,while,So I said get up that stairs So after a,he called Ben out and said I 'm sorry It 's just blah blah blah So anyway I said
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"So anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry","all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as bedamned you little shite"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,so,"So anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me and he said he was sorry and all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as bedamned you little shite",I came out to the bottom of the stairs
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,I hope it 's real sore,"Yeah, yeah what do you do then yeah Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah Mm Mm mm just one is it"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,e,"Yeah and the night that this 'd happened he had brought, the, one of the fellas back to stay in Mike 's house Mike was saying oh yeah I 'd like to have these parents coming down to me and all this kind of thing you know"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,then,"But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult, and cheeky and that But this kind of, look now that really makes you just boil, with rage you know","Really kind of trying it out you know And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know and he 's going to say no And what do you do And that you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it, you know"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,then,Yeah yeah Yeah that was for today was it Oh,Yeah he marched into me today saying can I have my pocket money Like he gets
P1A-097_Sisters_2,and,"Too young yeah yeah Mm, would he not be afraid of that","Ben said something and he, and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to you, in this tone And I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I wasn't speaking to you"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,but,Yeah yeah Yeah does really Bitter,"anyway he was just the face of him now would just stop a clock you know cos he can't have his bath Like he 's in there every, at least every second day, you know"
P1A-097_Sisters_2,but,feel uncomfortable,I
P1A-097_Sisters_2,but,Yeah anyway I said uhm,it 's kind of getting to the point where I 'll say that and he 's going to say no and then you 'll think what the hell do you do then
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"And my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies, what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one","Though I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say, let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland,in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,"it is after all the duty of garrison people by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",they have
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,to rediscover their identity as a community church,I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair",it 's got to be heard
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,They 're crumbling now in front of a world which is changing rapidly,the ideologues of both camps aren't prepared to accept that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,We know how dangerous that is,at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,They were constructed precisely in order not to live with one another,they were constructed precisely in order to have one group dominate over another
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around, the Catholic story and the Protestant story",you talk about prophetic voice
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,important uhm,people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,the Methodist Conference is currently meeting in Dublin One of the issues discussed on Friday concerned the role of Methodist societies in the local community,we pointed out at the beginning of the programme
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination,that 's its purpose I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"And I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation",which won't do it for us
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that,it isn't quite like that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,that do when it comes to looking at memory,how memory is used in telling a story
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it, it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision",uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,uhm both these ideologies,"we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,"I 'm just wondering whether that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland because, in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists, are no longer dominant in any real sense uh they don't have any control over, political power It 's it 's direct rule from Westminster",they don't have any
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,so,Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,also,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it, it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision",And uhm I think uh this is true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story, which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions therefore we have the right to call the tune","my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies, what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,And they won't get through that stage,we won't listen to them now to the dominating group
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,"the IRA does either I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they","I 'm not sure however that the IRA does either I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,But it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,a very good question is a division isn't it,I think what we 're seeing at the moment
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,And uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive,"has Catholic Nationalism any part to play for example in the struggle that is taking place in Northern Ireland today I mean what, uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism when they have their vision of a united Ireland"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"that in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this","uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,so,"And uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of, civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for, uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace, but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king","are you actually saying uh in a sense that uh the stories, the two stories one Protestant the other Catholic Nationalist one Protestant Loyalist, they 're actually crumbling"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"But you can't do it You must listen Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard","as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,so,"They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment",I take your point entirely
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,because I think the uh IRA and the INLA,"uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group,I 've called them those
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,however,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on But we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman",And it is important always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"Now, it 's not always going to be a nice experience to do so",you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if then,"it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",you 're going to dominate them you don't try to win them over as friends
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment",They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"I think that, that the Catholic Church, faced with the fact that it is losing ground, uhm is I would say reprehensibly accepting patronage uh from government sources",there is a strong anti-clericalism Uh they 're being used in other words to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"They 'll say that 's our vision We want, to to maintain the link with Britain",we want to maintain our Protestant ethos
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,"And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling",they see it
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"And I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us",the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that,"you can't do it You must listen Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this",Yeah I m not saying that I do
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer, uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism","I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,therefore,And the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance,"Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story, which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions we have the right to call the tune"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,though,let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another,I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those And that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it",uh uh that 's fine
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"It 's not a question of giving them uh equal respect, as is often said by well-meaning people, but rather to try and transcend these two uh mutually exclusive ideologies",that must be an extremely difficult thing to do
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine",it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,"what, uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism",they have their vision of a united Ireland
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,in other words,And there is a strong anti-clericalism Uh they 're being used,to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"Well I think it is that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination, and that 's its purpose I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell, it 's the use to which they put the story",the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,whose usefulness to their masters is over,we may put it like that without offensiveness
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,they listen to their own story uh,it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,in fact,Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that,"Yeah I m not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,You must listen,"uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say,that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"Yes yes I actually tried to talk about that in in this book right that it it must be taken uh uh on board by people particularly the establishment let us say in Dublin, uh that the Unionist people, are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over","it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,they should not win friends and influence people,you 've got to dominate people
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,But I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire,"uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of, civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for, uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace, but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,what they say,it 's not
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,So I take your point entirely,that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill and Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future",you must be sacrificed uh to this
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities,uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,when,that do,it comes to looking at memory
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,And that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill,Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for",that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on But we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman",it is important however always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,"And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling","if we won't listen to them now to the dominating group, they won't get through that stage"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,or,they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group,uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features,a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true,"uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because,it is told by the other group,it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,therefore,"Now their usefulness, in terms of the old imperial structures, is over That 's finished That story is finished","They are feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment"
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,if,you 're going,you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,Yeah,I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,but,"Now the British Empire has disappeared I think there are great forces that uhm are undermining the possibility of the future for all our children, in this island",I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,as,"And another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling",we do listen to one
P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,however,"Now uhm I think that uhm, the the Catholic Nationalism represented by the official Church organs in say let us say West Belfast has no particular vision for the future","Uh I 'm not sure that the IRA does either because I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they they are behaving as though the enemy uhm of us all is the British Empire"
P1A-095_Strep_infection,if,been better,he had 've just buggered off back to Belfast
P1A-095_Strep_infection,when,they told me,"I was over the last time and, oh"
P1A-095_Strep_infection,but,I know It would 've been better if he had 've just buggered off back to Belfast,"Exactly It 's on your own doorstep like she 's saying she 's apparently she 's Catherine her son who 's twenty-one, came back from Slane really really bad sore throat Streptococci infection his throat 'd closed up Took him to Moy clinic on"
P1A-095_Strep_infection,later,I came home and uh,See you babe
P1A-095_Strep_infection,and,"Conor and Estelle especially Estelle 2 sylls they told me when I was over the last time and, oh",I know what 's the story with them Are they still separated
P1A-095_Strep_infection,so,So uhm,Uh uh hold on 4 sylls Think my mobile 's about to go Ah it 's only John Alright how was your day
P1A-095_Strep_infection,then,She 's only,staying for one night and going back to going down to Armagh cos her friend 's getting married
P1A-095_Strep_infection,so,Well even at the end of the day half the photographs were shit anyway,You know what I mean It 's only the odd one that you might want to get developed
P1A-095_Strep_infection,then,"Just me and Don Well we 'd usually watch Will and Grace but the series is over, on Living So it was double bill last week so we had it on nine to ten and then the Teachers and 2 sylls Oh well What happened",a video couple of bottles of wine and an oul chat 2 sylls So I didn't come back here now until it was after six before I got sitting down and having a spliff And well I was getting up cos Mummy was on the phone so She was saying about uh Jamie and her being

P1A-095_Strep_infection,if,like uh no Uhm and he sat for a minute and he goes there 's several reasons,"she was coming back But uhm I just uh chanced me arm and uhm, asked him could I go, to be off tomorrow And he was like"
P1A-095_Strep_infection,so,No you see we 've our meetings on a Thursday,"I think he must be having a, an announcement or something"
P1A-095_Strep_infection,when,Anthony and Very cool I 'll get them developed somewhere good this time,youse didn't know they were being taken you know Trying to get some good candid shots

P1A-095_Strep_infection,as long as,,Oh just it gets you up

P1B-045_Sam_McAughtry,if,"when the fire needed coal, it was a certainty that","uh my mother ordered me to go out and get a shovel of coal, and I had a good seat beside the fire when I came back with the shovel of coal somebody"

P1B-045_Sam_McAughtry,and,he was drunk,it was the effects of the gas
P1B-045_Sam_McAughtry,and,And lots of the people round our district got their husbands to sign for this half a crown deposit,paid a half a crown got the radio set and of course they couldn't keep up the payments

P1B-045_Sam_McAughtry,or,when you looked at the street from the outside,when you went inside
P1B-045_Sam_McAughtry,and,"We had a man, pardon me we had a man living opposite us who was a bailiff His job was to throw people out for non-payment of rent We 'd another man living opposite us who shovelled coal in the uh gasworks",He was a labourer uh one night he came back and everybody thought he was drunk and it was the effects of the gas

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,And we 've got to come alongside them and try to help them,"that 's why I 'm very happy that in this year I will have the opportunity to work with the other Churches and to work closely with them, in for there are many areas that we can share together"

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,And the people have turned from God and from righteousness and we are trying to call them back to the right way of living,"you see people who perhaps, commit these sins alcoholism or shoplifting which you say should be called theft They 're already the marginalised"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,That 's what he 's saying and that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to,do you think people are going to listen to you
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,"that, perhaps they haven't turned away from God",society has turned away from them
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,what he 's saying,that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,And that 's just a sad business if they do because it 's not It 's the gathering of God 's people together,it 's a matter of them going out with the message
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God and the right ways of living Righteousness says the Bible, exalteth a nation but sin, is a disgrace to any people",the people have turned from God and from righteousness and we are trying to call them back to the right way of living
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"Well have I found often Patrick that, whenever a situation gets a little bit tight whether in session committee or any other, meeting that if you can inject a little humour, without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off and perhaps it does help to to to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I suppose blessed with a warped sense of humour or cursed with it whatever way you like to put it, that leaves me that I 've got to be a little bit careful in case I don't say too much too soon","yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour, but some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,in Carlisle House we 're doing some more of that same sort of thing We 're interested in unemployment,"we can do it far better together, as the different Churches coming together in these sort of things"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,The new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Dr Andrew Rodgers,there 'll be more from the General Assembly later in the programme
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"that perhaps you put too much emphasis, on those sins","I put it in inverted commas committed, by people who are marginalised For example theft is is a poor person 's sin as it were"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God,"that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do, we as a church must get alongside those who have this tendency as we must get alongside those who are, uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with or that they have eventually found within themselves and fight that tendency"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,s just a sad business,they do because it 's not It
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"The result of over five hundred and fifty submissions from various church and secular groups, whose main concern was to find a solution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland From the start of its deliberation the Opsahl Commission had a difficult task MP Ken Maginnis dismissed it The Northern Catholic Bishops failed to make a contribution",some Republican community activists were suspicious of making a submission for fear of being politically vetted Apart from the SDLP who preferred to study the documents before giving a considered opinion
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,all the children are expected to gather together and help out on the farm They don't get paid for doing that,people live on a farm for example
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God,that as the result of it being pleasing to God will be wholesome and happy for them
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,when,But how can you manage to do that successfully,you 've already criticised your own Church in a sense for being more like a social club
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,And one of the things that we noticed particularly is for example in the Shankill Road Mission we 're employing a hundred and seventy 1 syll workers,"in Carlisle House we 're doing some more of that same sort of thing We 're interested in unemployment and we can do it far better together, as the different Churches coming together in these sort of things"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,because,they do,it 's not It
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,a if you 're a mother,you 're single parent
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,that without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off and perhaps it does help to to to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I,you can inject a little humour
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"Dr John Dunlop During his term of office the new Moderator intends to lead a personal crusade, to make the Christian message more apparent in society here",that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if then,"you 've got a if you 're a mother and you 're single parent, and you you haven't got enough money you 've got to feed your child",well of course
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,also,"And as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values, we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right",on the programme we join pilgrims going to the island of Inishmacsaint in County Fermanagh Morning service at half past ten comes from Gilnahirk Presbyterian Church in Belfast
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,And we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right,the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,in the case of the rich sin 's still sin,"there 's still rich, uh"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,so that,isn't it really,it 's because of a turning away from God
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,before,to study the documents,giving a considered opinion
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,if,you 've got a,you 're a mother and you 're single parent
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,because,the poor people doing it,"they are so poor but in the case of the rich sin 's still sin and there 's still rich, uh going for theft and all the other things"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,they are so poor going for theft and all the other things,"in the case of the rich sin 's still sin and there 's still rich, uh"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,that we as a church,this is what I was trying to do
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,The tendency itself is not sin,how can you manage to do that successfully when you 've already criticised your own Church in a sense for being more like a social club
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,as,"that perhaps some of the language that you used, might have been seen",perhaps a little insensitive I 'm thinking about your reference to gay and saying that that was an inept euphemism It 's a way they like to describe themselves

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,I suppose other communities as well,where would you locate what you see as the moral decay What has brought it about
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,you 've got a if you 're a mother and you 're single parent,you you

P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,Moderator thank you for joining us on Sunday Sequence,thank you for having me
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,though,And that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly,First did he feel that a useful asset for any moderator at general assembly was a sense of humour
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,Well if if Yes I take your point that we 've got to recognise why they do this,we 've got to come alongside them and try to help them
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,There 's this area of unemployment that you 've just mentioned and we are interested in doing all we can at every area in every place for that uh particular problem,"one of the things that we noticed particularly is for example in the Shankill Road Mission we 're employing a hundred and seventy 1 syll workers, and in Carlisle House we 're doing some more of that same sort of thing We 're interested in unemployment and we can do it far better together, as the different Churches coming together in these sort of things"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,It 's just part and parcel of living They get to know that there is required of them co-operation and concern,they live together in a family bunch
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"different things happening on a farm animals being born and so forth And there 's a wholesomeness of attitude to nature and to sex and to all that sort of thing and the family unit And very very often in the country you still find uh the vestiges of family worship and family discipline, and indeed family fun They go off for the day together as a family And of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country There 's a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller and the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of","they get a interest into and a and a an insight into, uh, sex to be quite blunt, through just living on the farm and seeing the animals and so forth being born"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations,"as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values, we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,yet,"some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship",And you 've got a wonderful sense of humour
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God,"the right ways of living Righteousness says the Bible, exalteth a nation but sin, is a disgrace to any people"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"I 'm trying to point the Church and the people that they will I hope uh in some way or other influence back to the basic principles of good wholesome living, not a censorious business at all but rather here 's the right way to live God made us, he redeemed us by his son and here 's the way to live",I don't want to be seen to be censoring people God leaves out for us clear rules for good wholesome living
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,but,And yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour,"some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"Is that because people see the Church, as a club, a social club",I 'm afraid to say that many cases they do that 's just a sad business if they do because it 's not It 's the gathering of God 's people together and it 's a matter of them going out with the message that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God and that as the result of it being pleasing to God will be wholesome and happy for them
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,"if you can inject a little humour, without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off",perhaps it does help to to to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,or,"as we must get alongside those who are, uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with",that they have eventually found within themselves
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,because,Is that,"people see the Church, as a club, a social club"
P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,and,of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country There 's a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller,the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of
P1A-099_Dresses,but,Uhm,I don't know what to wear with it
P1A-099_Dresses,but,oh we got all of ours,we didn't get yours

P1A-099_Dresses,or,Mm,could Martin
P1A-099_Dresses,but,Well we could then,we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad We 'd be friendlier with her
P1A-099_Dresses,and,Fintan rang me actually right after uhm I put down the phone to you Remember that night,"He was like, you have to come You have to come I was like, no I can't"
P1A-099_Dresses,and,it 'll fit you,I 'm like no no I want it to be big

P1A-099_Dresses,if,it work,I wore four inches would
P1A-099_Dresses,and,No I don't think I know it,"Well Rosemary and I went in for a look and uhm I found a lovely red dress I was like delighted with it and everything And I brought mum up to see it, and she totally ditched it"
P1A-099_Dresses,if,like give them the sixty quid,you knew one of the guys who were collecting the tickets
P1A-099_Dresses,and,she bought it for herself then,I bought it off her

P1A-099_Dresses,then,Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that I think that 's including Fintan if we can get him to come but we probably won't be able to,And it 's like you know we 're trying to get them on

P1A-099_Dresses,but,Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that I think that 's including Fintan if we can get him to come,we probably won't be able to
P1A-099_Dresses,though,Back to the old days,Yeah I think we 'll end up going to Declan 's
P1A-099_Dresses,besides,And I That was the last resort,don't want to ring Martin
P1A-099_Dresses,and,Yeah He called in,I was like make sure you ring Hilary
P1A-099_Dresses,and,it 's uhm Charles as well,that I think that 's including Fintan
P1B-046_Elections,and,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
P1B-046_Elections,if,"the new government have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio","they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage"
P1B-046_Elections,if,"be removed and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position",they 're not doing the job
P1B-046_Elections,if,"Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but",the trust is not there from the start
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair",he 's been very fair to all sides
P1B-046_Elections,if then,"the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down",the government won't survive Certainly
P1B-046_Elections,and,"And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio","the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person"
P1B-046_Elections,but,Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers while Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition,how long will that state of affairs continue
P1B-046_Elections,and,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds And I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"You only bring those people together if we are conscious, of their concerns",if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen
P1B-046_Elections,if,"because he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours",they did
P1B-046_Elections,but,by,I thought the experience certainly was an interesting one I. I 've said to people I learned more in the last two weeks than I 've perhaps possibly learnt in my previous seventeen years in Leinster House
P1B-046_Elections,if,Uh,you just take the allocation of portfolios for example
P1B-046_Elections,as,"that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem",I said earlier
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet And as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending",that certainly doesn't indicate to me that Fine Gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party
P1B-046_Elections,and,"they seem to want to avoid dealing with that And because of the amount of fudge on, crucial issues, local charges, and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem",I think from the programme for government it 's clear the government don't understand that
P1B-046_Elections,because,previously uhm would lose child support,they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh
P1B-046_Elections,but,"I think Prionsias De Rossa and John Bruton have worked well in opposition, uh so I don't see that as a problem",I don't
P1B-046_Elections,and,"the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down",once it did everything else collapsed
P1B-046_Elections,and,I hope it 's not going to continue,I certainly think it 's very unfair on the new government In a period
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Well as we saw at the break of the last government, obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems",I think that may well be the case with this government too
P1B-046_Elections,but,on,joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader
P1B-046_Elections,so,uh,I don't see that as a problem
P1B-046_Elections,and,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds And I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair, and he 's been very fair to all sides","if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position And I hope that the government won't proceed with that And certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Northern Ireland policy, they 've control over broadcasting",they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum
P1B-046_Elections,previously,a lot of people,who uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh
P1B-046_Elections,if,"And And I hope that the government won't proceed with that And certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats","somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position"
P1B-046_Elections,and,We 'll be returning to the Peace Process a bit later on but joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader,"the new Minister for Social Welfare Prionsias de Rossa First of all, congratulations on your new appointment It 's uh it 's a high-spending department"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"they seem to want to avoid dealing with that And because of the amount of fudge on, crucial issues, local charges","I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem"
P1B-046_Elections,because,I supported the nominee of Fine Gael in the last occasion,I think it 's important that the opposition has that position Until recent years the opposition always had that position
P1B-046_Elections,because,Or it won't really exist but if the trust is not there from the start,"to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"uh, ever ever ever achieved",that is in relation to child
P1B-046_Elections,because,"Peter Sutherland, earlier this year","if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours"
P1B-046_Elections,therefore,"the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person","And I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"that a lot of people who, previously uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh will no longer do so","it will eliminate a lot of uhm, poverty traps It"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person",I don't know if they could be certain of that and I think they need to be very careful It 's not a question of putting in our own
P1B-046_Elections,and,"I think, the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government",it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment
P1B-046_Elections,because,We have to we have to have competitive state enterprises able to compete in the market,"of our membership of EU, we have to be responsible"
P1B-046_Elections,because,This is a period of uncertainty,we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts
P1B-046_Elections,and,"I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission","therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person"
P1B-046_Elections,if then,to do,that I think we 're going to cause further problems Already
P1B-046_Elections,or,it won't really exist but if the trust is not there from the start,"because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation"
P1B-046_Elections,if,certainly they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats,they do
P1B-046_Elections,if,to cause big problems for John Bruton,the architect of the process is standing behind at him shouting from the sidelines uh
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Uhm I was very disappointed with the way he handled the negotiations for the formation of government, despite the fact that Fine Gael had fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party the Labour Party seemed to call all the shots","Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending"
P1B-046_Elections,while,Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers,Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition
P1B-046_Elections,but,"because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation",if the trust is not there from the start
P1B-046_Elections,or,"I think it will, be a question of whether not",trust can be established between the three party leaders
P1B-046_Elections,and,"We have to because of our membership of EU, we have to be responsible, we have to have competitive state enterprises able to compete in the market","I think from the programme for government it 's clear the government don't understand that, and they seem to want to avoid dealing with that because of the amount of fudge on, crucial issues, local charges, and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem"

P1B-046_Elections,if,"the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio",they were going to change the person
P1B-046_Elections,and,And I don't know if they could be certain of that,I think they need to be very careful It 's not a question of putting in our own
P1B-046_Elections,if,those people together,"we are conscious, of their concerns"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair, and he 's been very fair to all sides","And if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position And I hope that the government won't proceed with that certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats"
P1B-046_Elections,if,to destroy the process,he continues speaking like this
P1B-046_Elections,and,"I don't believe it is I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party, it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party","I see very little evidence, of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"we 're talking about personal, personal relationships being very very important How do you think Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on",This is the first inter-party government for for forty years
P1B-046_Elections,and,"He must be aware, of the need for, sensitivity","Albert Reynolds himself was very concerned just over a year ago when a very important document was leaked to a journalist he expressed that concern The problem we have in Northern Ireland is that, we 've, two divided, communities a divided people"
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Well I 've already said that those comments were, unwise and insensitive",I repeat that I was very surprised
P1B-046_Elections,and,"In relation to Padraig Flynn, the personality of the Commissioner is not the issue","I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission"
P1B-046_Elections,if,it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept,you take the attitude to state enterprise
P1B-046_Elections,once,"to work together as a team the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down and",it did everything else collapsed
P1B-046_Elections,also,One issue they 'll have to resolve quite quickly is the position of the European Commissioner and,the Leas Ceann Comhairle
P1B-046_Elections,and,if they 're not doing the job,uhm being removed from that position
P1B-046_Elections,and,"This is a period of uncertainty because we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts I 've given my assurance and that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support, what they do",I hope that Fianna Fa/il do likewise
P1B-046_Elections,if,I think,you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party
P1B-046_Elections,as,Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending,I said
P1A-094_Health,so that,Uh-huh,"s that, no that 's this year over like and so I 've, nothing again now The end of September it starts again"
P1A-094_Health,so,Yeah,yeah I was well pleased
P1A-094_Health,but,"Yeah yeah shattering, several sylls",you know So listen enough of me What about you What 's been happening
P1A-094_Health,so,Yeah they 're scattering it with uh injections Uh,uh it 's uh they say almost back to normal now And uhm yeah he 's he 's but he 's he was in good form when I left you know And I think Mum was glad Lisa and I were up for the company And Lisa distracts her uhm
P1A-094_Health,and,Yeah Yeah this is the same It 's really hit me just coming home there I was fine all day And uhm it 's one of those things when you don't think about it I know it sounds stupid like but uh,Yeah Mhm Yeah well I think well maybe if you were indoors all day and then you just came out that 's probably why then the evening I think is worse And they say that 's cos the pollen is settling

P1A-094_Health,then,Mad stuff,And uhm so the babysitter 's going to mind Lisa when you 're down there
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs,Yeah career-wise it was shaping up well for you then
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Just to explain to people he was the Irish scout who had sent over all the Irish players in those years,"That 's right That 's right sent over all those Irish players then at the time I remember uhm it was based on his word really that I think Dave Sexton turned around and went, that 'll do he 'll do for us"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I went over for the trial
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"because when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Mm,You know his word was that well respected by Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,that 's,I wanted to go away to Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,as well Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs,when am I going to come back for the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,as well Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs and,am I going to come back for the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,That 's right yeah That 's right Covering every blade of grass,uhm That
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on",after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Listen tell us this about uh when this long-haired fella arrived out to training first None of you knew knew him well Jimmy,"No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty and he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so that,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it So I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days",helped enormously and then after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as soon as,there was no sort of watering period with him,he came into the team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,later,,"A household name in, in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry A couple of years sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad and today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,"uh, reshown",often I mean you missed it but it 's they keep reshowing it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,But you know,you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,And you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,Moran coming into the team,you were All-Ireland champions You wouldn't have known a lot about him sure you wouldn't
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,amazed me you know,I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as,to come back for the Dubs I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but,you say they just uh
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Yeah,who 's a big soccer fan as well Hello Mike
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD,I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,"I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked he screwed her off a wee bit You know,one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked he screwed her off a wee bit You know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,"uh, the move to Manchester United were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time",you were
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,after,"sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and",massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,us this about uh,this long-haired fella arrived out to training first None of you knew knew him well Jimmy
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually it 's only like two or three years really,I look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,I know,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,the soccer career went on and on,I think I always wanted to come back for the Dubs I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but as you say they just uh
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,And rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career,you go around Ireland
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,That must have been strange,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,I think,I was about seventeen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Mike 's still on the line there That was uh there was huge hype in in the country in those days wasn't there,"Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it We enjoyed the games We won some and we lost some I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads, and vice versa with them"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs,Yeah And career-wise it was shaping up well for you
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,We won some,we lost some
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,he would,he 'd kicked it normally
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less,you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match,you hadn't
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers",like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Yeah,uh I remember that now I played mid-field I think
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I said I couldn't do it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,That must have been strange,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it So I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,That 's right yeah I know,"Des sorry but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"It was never a Honda fifty by the by the way It was a Honda ninety, 3 sylls You wouldn't know how to get onto onto one of them now",you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty","he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,It was,"when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it,he drop-kicked
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"I always remember the skill factor in them was, amazed me you know because I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were",how many of those other fellas made it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,"Oh, you 'd be lucky","you 're talking about one, two"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,whereas,all year round,most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,A youth team Yeah,"There 'd be a, maybe a few reserve team players in it as well plus youth team players it was kind of like a very young team and that but very"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself,I 've got to give it a try I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well if you were watching that particular game,Mm you came back over and it was kind of a secret at first wasn't it about you
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well,you were watching that particular game
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,though,And you were a fairly close-knit team,Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as if,it 's only like two or three years really,I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,so often I mean you missed it,it 's they keep reshowing it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over,I just said to myself
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,Yeah that 's right that 's right,the least I could have done was to run around the place
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,The Dubs were actually going so well at the time,I 'd no real interest You know I think when I was about seventeen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it it 's only like two or three years really,"when you go around Ireland, rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,after,little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Yeah,at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,No there was a game They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that,which team was it The first team or the reserves
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,So you came back over,it was kind of a secret at first
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage,we were all fairly seasoned footballers
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Not initially anyway but,"I remember actually seeing him uh in Tralee sometime He played a played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say, early seventy-six probably you know and I remember I was resting I said I was injured but, we usually took breaks in those days during the winter I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"A household name in, in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry A couple of years later, sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad",today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as,I was treated the same and that And uhm,them Yeah
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,But Des sorry ve drop-kicked that ball,"that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,And uhm That,I know because I couldn't catch balls I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"I remember I was resting I said I was injured but, we usually took breaks in those days during the winter But I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know",probably you know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,So that helped enormously and,after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm,as you say they just uh
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen","Hanahoe, and myself to get on with the training and like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day I think it 's something we all appreciated He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,what he was going to do to us the following September,a few other years you
P1A-098_Bad_weather,and,Yeah wouldn't couldn't be fucking arsed I think going out in it,it 's fucking minging I really would
P1A-098_Bad_weather,and,Well Eithne 's been away in Spain,"so I don't really like being, out sitting in the house on my own, cos once you get out there, it 's it 's a case of you 're stuck there for the night You wouldn't even go to the shop, cos it 's too dangerous to even walk up the Antrim Road"
P1A-098_Bad_weather,so,Yeah might see what the craic is tomorrow maybe,Seanie was saying as well So

P1A-098_Bad_weather,and,"You know you 're so stuck in a rut and, the bills coming in",it 's even worse
P1A-098_Bad_weather,once,"And, so I don't really like being, out sitting in the house on my own, cos it 's it 's a case of you 're stuck there for the night You wouldn't even go to the shop, cos it 's too dangerous to even walk up the Antrim Road",you get out there

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"With no, uh and no compass, no sense of where I am So I do believe in roots","You 're searching in your I remember uh in the Oilea/n Suite the Suite Oilea/n you, uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni/ Dho/mhnaill 's for instance Uh Oilea/n 'se/ mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire My body, is an island in the midst of a vast sea uh, a lot of your music seems to be, have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition And it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh going through, it 's in the searching Am I wrong in that"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"whatever reason they need to go beyond it or, beneath it or, beside it, uhm it 's a time like that",there 's a there is a lot of that I think
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"Yes and uh some of your stuff it seems to me even 3 sylls is, uh you could sell that as a single","Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single As it is it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra yeah it has it has it it does You know I don't deliberately write music which is potentially popular, but some of the music I would write or or or work out, on the keyboard or otherwise, happens to be in the realms of popularity You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it, uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound I have friends who, who work, exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible, for, you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless, 4 sylls Like"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,Yeah but you 've brought it into the marketplace,"Yes I know I suppose that 's why I 'm saying it because in a way I 'm speaking to some degree from experience Luckily, not too much into the market as I haven't been faced with, certain problems which would obviously come up if you begin to do that I have my toes have dipped into the water 4 sylls"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,"because there 's, one thing you can't sell it 's that of course",there is spirit in it and you
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"Yeah Do you think it shouldn't be or, are you striving to go, beyond the melody","I 'm striving to go yes I 'm, no not so much beyond I would I am, what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality And to me music is, a sound that you send out a bit like a scout, to check, the ground, and to clear the overgrowth, and then you enter into the space It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you, you see"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,as,to be increasingly,I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,Yeah,"I 'm you know like, uh"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible Uh uh, but but I 'm not really But","there is, there is something of the times that if one, expresses, a time that one lives in and the time we live in now is uh, is actually a searching by all kinds of people for the spirit"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,would obviously come up,you begin to do that But I have my toes
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,Mm,"I think rather than resisting this, uhm I think we should help it along I think we should actively, seek, uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I don't know I don't think it need be thrown out but it 's a kind of a post-nationalism, in a way, that 's the way I would describe it"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"As it is it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra But, yeah it has it has it it does You know I don't deliberately write music which is potentially popular","some of the music I would write or or or work out, on the keyboard or otherwise, happens to be in the realms of popularity"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,so,"Are you a, religious individual would you say","Uhm I 'm, uhm uhm yes Uh no I would think yes Yes in the sense that I would pray, uh in the sense that I couldn't imagine, life without a belief in a loving God You know it just doesn't make sense to me yes I am religious In that sense I suppose I 'm very religious, but not necessarily in an institutionalised sense Uhm"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"And if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them, or for some reason or another","I think, that they feel for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or, beneath it or, beside it, uhm it 's a time like that and there 's a there is a lot of that I think, of that timelessness in music right now But I do believe music is political I do believe that all music all true music, is political I do think it 's a political statement because it 's a it 's a statement of where you are, at a particular point of time And I strongly believe that I mean, okay it 's easy to see particularly in, like nationalistic music you know if you pick for example you mentioned O/ Riada if you pick an obvious one there Mise E/ire"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"I would feel part of a generation, which was uh at the uh, at the cutting edge certainly",we were the first ones to bang into the wall of the problem of globalisation and global culture
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"you can hear, even in certain players playing fast music, a reel which is supposed to be joyous","it 's tinged in some way or other, with this colour of uaigneas"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,that uh said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano,he heard the record I had done
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,to leave go of it,"if I feel I do, in the context of this globalisation, well I 'm out to sea"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"Absolutely and the piano of course is a very cosmopolitan, suave instrument you know","to play it with uh, to play Irish music on it, you know it 's a bit like, you know playing it with wellingtons on or something, do you know"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,"you bring art into the marketplace You know that 's where the sparks fly you see, because if there is spirit in it and you, there 's, one thing you can't sell it 's that of course even",you know it 's there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,my music,twas released in America
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,And uh he 's a friend of mine,he sent me on a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,so,"I don't want to leave go of it because if I feel I do, in the context of this globalisation, well I 'm out to sea","With no, uh and no compass, no sense of where I am I do believe in roots"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,where you should be,you want to be there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,"who, who work, exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible, for, you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know","I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless, 4 sylls Like"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,n,the the music you make
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,the sparks fly you see,"if there is spirit in it and you, there 's, one thing you can't sell it 's that of course"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,Mm Yeah,all of that kind of feeling Music is a wonderful way of of expressing that
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,"we should actively, seek, uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I don't know I don't think it need be thrown out","it 's a kind of a post-nationalism, in a way, that 's the way I would describe it"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him,many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular I mean let me tell you that these are not popular
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,it 's uh otherwise its joyful,there 's a melancholia uh going through
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,because,,there are European
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,Mm,"uaigneas, is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear, even in certain players playing fast music, a reel which is supposed to be joyous, but it 's tinged in some way or other, with this colour of uaigneas"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,I know they would have a huge problem,"I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular I mean let me tell you that these are not popular, under any circumstances"

P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"Well I 'm I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry, in particular, who is a Clare man and who lives in Dublin and who wrote, spent ten years of his life writing an opera, called The Intelligence Park which got its premiere in London and Dublin, this summer","uh he 's a friend of mine and, he sent me on a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"And uh he 's a friend of mine and, he sent me on a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to","I think it 's extremely complex music I couldn't ask, most of my friends to listen to it You know"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,that one lives in,the time we live in now is uh
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,but,Well it is about Ireland,"you know it 's the time The time is you we we cannot uh afford, to relax into that comfortable feeling of culture and nationalism anymore"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,Mm,"if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them, or for some reason or another"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,if you pick for example you mentioned O/ Riada,you pick an obvious one there
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,if,Yes yes absolutely agree,it were just the music on its own you still would feel that
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,"And that was a bit mean But, there is an Irishness","the Irishness for me in the music, piano music I play is like an anchor, a vital anchor"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,You 'd say that 's Ireland,"Yeah that 's Ireland That 's right it 's uh that particular kind of feeling about Ireland, you know which, one be describe it as cultural nationalist"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,then,"to me music is, a sound that you send out a bit like a scout, to check, the ground, and to clear the overgrowth",you enter into the space It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,Well you know,you really come up against it
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,when,"he doesn't quite know what he 's going to, do He hopes, that he, starts off very simply, and hopes that he can elaborate","he starts off, with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas"
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,and,who lives in Dublin,who wrote
P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,so,American influences in your music at least,it seems to me
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,or,"religiously whereas if you go to other areas like the Shankill or other areas there 's a we 've got that sort of Protestant individualism And uhm I I. I see enormous strides being made in other areas, tremendous funds being poured into other areas and quite rightly so too And it seemed to me that perhaps we weren't getting our act together And that we should look for uhm uh expertise people like maybe solicitors and bankers and trade unionists and community workers and retired civil servants other people like that who might be help help us and help clergy and parishes uh in formulating schemes and Yeah I 'm afraid I my my appeal didn't meet with any great uh response Perhaps uh it 's just uh that we are indifferent",perhaps it 's the difficulty getting people to own an idea Maybe
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,if,"you uh deliver an attack on obscenity, nudity, pornography, lack of privacy but don't",I may so describe it You
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,that and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end,but we must sort of think things through
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,So you you think that there there has to be a reconstruction as it were of moral values in the community,"No I think the moral values are there but the facts are that, uhm uh so much has been happening in the community uhm through things like uhm uhm much more of uhm uh use of video and and film and so forth, uh and the cashing in on obscenity I think that uh the film industry for years was in in some decline and now has uh through through the use of way-out producers have now begun to uhm uh produce, uhm films uh which have been condemned by a large circle of people I mean Lord Rees-Mogg recently uhm sounded criticism of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's uh Terminator films And so many other films too seem to highlight violence I mean you 've only got to go to Silence of the Lambs and so forth people are beginning to I think see that the whole swing of the pendulum has gone far too far, and that that it begets violence"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,You must be aware of that stream of thinking,"There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they, they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth uhm"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,Yes but but your comments about Protestant disadvantage and the need for uh support both financial and skilled echo the views of uh a man I interviewed the other day former UDA man Glen Barr You were were at one with his views on this one,"Yes, yes indeed I would be Indeed I would be I believe that there 's tremendous goodwill out there There I believe I 'm sure there 's goodwill in the government I 'm sure there 's goodwill in in forms like the, the the Ireland Fund Uh all sorts of other, funds have got to be tapped And I 'm I was delighted uh on to see on on yesterday 's paper that uhm there 's another uh substantial sum of money being pumped into making Belfast work Already a hundred and twenty-four million has been pumped in uhm to to various areas and I 'm delighted that but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,when,Yeah well I Yeah No I think that I wouldn't ah I think that certainly it can be called sin certainly but there 's also a question that people are are are uh find themselves with these genes in their bodies and so forth and they 've got to learn to live with it It,"s only it 's uh it 's only when it is uhm used wrongly People cannot alter their genes They can't alter their balance and so forth I wouldn't want to go down that road too far but that wasn't, that wasn't the area which I was, dealing with in my address"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,Now perhaps uh the feeling is or the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities Maybe that 's the reason,"Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, uh I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,"Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say And it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, uh I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment","Now you you mentioned this uh Roman Catholic community and the, cohesion and and the efforts to obtain you mentioned grants going to places like Poleglass the New Lodge I think North Howard Street something in the region of fifteen million pounds uh, you 've been saying that you admire their success I mean I am sure and I accept it is admire and not covet"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,but,"it 's quite admire I feel that they have got their their their act together And uh look at the scheme in Poleglass valued at five point one million, it it it obviously has, uh involved a lot of people who have got the project right and have thought it out and prepared the whole ground well I 'm quite certain money is there at the government level",you must get your act together
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,"There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they, they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth And uhm","I think that we 're now sort of uh uh in we now in a situation where there 's all sorts of alienation We so often talk about the alienation of the uh Roman Catholic or Nationalist community with Britain but there 's even an alienation now I think between, between Loyalists and Unionists from Britain an an alienation even between the haves and the have-nots And I think that so often uh in in the Protestant areas especially you find that the the poverty lies behind swathes of area of considerable affluence we must be we must be aware of this and we must try and bring uhm a cohesion of the situation whereby something is done to ameliorate this situation"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,or,Now perhaps the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities Maybe that 's the reason,uh the feeling is
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,so forth which focus on human sexuality which can be beautiful and thought to be in good taste I think that sometimes we Christian people can damage our cause not a little by uh over-reacting to all that nudity thing The body human body is God-given God-made It is beautiful but what makes it pornographic is when someone presents it to be nastily suggestive and alluring And I think that is one of the the great problems,"And I think that there 's nothing wrong with uh as I tried to say this morning there 's nothing wrong in in nudity at all Nobody 's ever saying anything there 's anything wrong with that I mean you can look at many ancient uhm, uhm statues in in in Egypt You can look at many Middle Ages paintings"
P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,and,"Now let me ask you uh uh briefly about some other aspects of of your address and, uh the moral crusade if I may so describe it You you uh deliver an attack on obscenity, nudity, pornography, lack of privacy but don't, these uh don't those things pale set beside the obscenity of murder, violence, intolerance, bigotry and hate The real villains of the piece in this community","Well of course obscenity, where does obscenity flourish most It flourishes in the areas of sexuality, of cruelty and violence The whole three are connected up together indeed uh uh uh very often it is sometimes, uh racketeering and paramilitary racketeering that uh cashes in on the shortcomings of other people And we have heard of that uh of of them uh pirating uh videos and things like that to sell for their for their own ill-gotten gain and so forth And uhm I think that uhm, that that really there 's only a thin paper wall between those three areas of sexuality cruelty and violence"
