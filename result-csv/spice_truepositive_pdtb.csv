P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,and,One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities,uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community

P1B-046_Elections,and,"I think, the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government",it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment
P1B-046_Elections,and,"Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet And as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending",that certainly doesn't indicate to me that Fine Gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less,you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Yeah,uh I remember that now I played mid-field I think
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm,as you say they just uh
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,Not initially anyway but,"I remember actually seeing him uh in Tralee sometime He played a played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say, early seventy-six probably you know and I remember I was resting I said I was injured but, we usually took breaks in those days during the winter I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know"

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,so often I mean you missed it,it 's they keep reshowing it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,That 's right yeah I know,"Des sorry but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,but,ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it,he drop-kicked
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on",after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs,Yeah career-wise it was shaping up well for you then
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,The Dubs were actually going so well at the time,I 'd no real interest You know I think when I was about seventeen
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I said I couldn't do it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I said I couldn't do it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,No there was a game They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that,which team was it The first team or the reserves
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,Mm,You know his word was that well respected by Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"because when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"I remember I was resting I said I was injured but, we usually took breaks in those days during the winter But I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know",probably you know
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty","he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they"

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers",like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen

P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,and,We won some,we lost some
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,"uh, the move to Manchester United were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time",you were
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,amazed me you know,I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,It was,"when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,because,I know,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,that 's,I wanted to go away to Manchester United
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I went over for the trial
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,"I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually it 's only like two or three years really,I look back on it
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,And rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career,you go around Ireland
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,when,Moran coming into the team,you were All-Ireland champions You wouldn't have known a lot about him sure you wouldn't
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD,I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so,Yeah that 's right that 's right,the least I could have done was to run around the place
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,then,So that helped enormously and,after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,"Oh, you 'd be lucky","you 're talking about one, two"
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well,you were watching that particular game
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match,you hadn't
P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,if,he would,he 'd kicked it normally
