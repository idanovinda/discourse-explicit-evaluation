P1B-046_Elections,if,"i think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between fine gael democratic left and the labour party, it 's very much the policy approach of democratic left and the labour party"
P1B-046_Elections,if,"if you take the attitude to state enterprise, it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept"
P1B-046_Elections,if,"uhm if the three party leaders don't make an enormous effort to work together as a team the government will collapse or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive certainly"
