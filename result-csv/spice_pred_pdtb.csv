and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation","Well uhm I applied then, uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it"
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"that uh you know you had, two children, who were growing up","also you had uh, your horses and you had your other outside interests"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,I 'll apply,"if I 'm accepted, well and good"
so,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"I finished my prayers by praying for a pony, but the pony never came We weren't a very well-off family so I 'm afraid a pony 's worth, it 'd beyond our means",I just rode on other people
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"My late husband was a great horseman and we used to break, in young horses and show them You know so I love showing a horse, and I love dressage",three-day eventing would be what we 're interested in mostly you know the dressage cross country and the show jumping
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf, they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with, steel or iron supports, so those hadn't been properly secured unfortunately",as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church","Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy And uhm I enjoyed doing that But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said, you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good And that 's just how I did it"
for example,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,It 's hard to say Padraig really Uhm,"I think with riding, it 's just being at one with your animal, you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do And it 's very exhilarating Racing going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating, very thrilling"
because,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"it made more difficult, definitely more difficult",you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say, and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted",what had you thought to do
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"No no that was quite dormant at that stage, totally dormant I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters so on","but, entering the church had never, entered my mind, at that stage"
then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year",people said
if,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,God 's prompting,"you like but I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it"
then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,So then what was the the next stage in your career,"Well uhm I applied uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it, and I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation"
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"she 's a bit hot for the dressage a bit excitable, but good for the show jumping I think","Wren 's Hill, and out of a chasing-bred mare so she 's got a little bit of both flat and chasing blood in her, and she 's very promising as a show jumper I thought she might 've done dressage"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,that the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding I found it very thrilling,really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,It is Yes it is,it 's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away Yes it 's lovely here
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,I think she 's she 's uh telling us something,her just off the grass yes I don't know what it is
although,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"But again you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good","I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said"
so,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,a number of young people and children coming on,"it 's very promising, for the future I think We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,It 's hard to say Padraig really Uhm,"I think with riding, it 's just being at one with your animal, you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do it 's very exhilarating Racing for example going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating, very thrilling"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and, the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding I found it very thrilling",I rode out on the race horses
then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church","Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy And uhm I enjoyed doing that But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said, you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church And I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good And that 's just how I did it"
also,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"Well uhm I applied then, uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it, and I was, accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation","As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've had to bear in mind that uh you know you had, two children, who were growing up but also you had uh, your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those"
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,you like,"I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it"
then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"God 's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it","And when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church"
when,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,And then,"did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church"
so,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"That 's right yes that 's right, uhm it did Frank was killed in an accident He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry And you know how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf, they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with, steel or iron supports, so those hadn't been properly secured, and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock Took me quite a while to get over that","there you were, unexpectantly, widowed and two children to take care of"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"No no but, eventually then I was trained I was trained by Captain Jeremy Beale who was a member of the British Olympic Team, for a couple of years I went to him then I went to Miss Iris Kellett in Dublin for many years, and in Kill in County Kildare",oh no no I wasn't No I at the beginning I rode on other people 's
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"Well in Bailieborough we have three churches, one just in the town and two in the country The Manse of course is also in the country, and I 've got about a hundred and thirty families to look after Quite a number of elderly folk","also, quite a number of young folk children and young married people This mare is determined determined to eat me isn't she or eat my coat Yes quite a number of young people and children coming on so it 's very promising, for the future I think We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough in July and, quite a number of people roundabout interested in show jumping as such and horses, and very good relations with other you know churches in the community which is marvellous too, very very good relationships"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,And a teacher,"a teacher, and what was it then that was, within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself evident"
because,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted",of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say

then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,So what,was the the next stage in your career
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,How did you set about picking up the pieces,"Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say, and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted"
as long as,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,if I don't win,the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself For me that 's the main thing
so,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"We have this young mare, a brood mare, an old ex-racehorse and a couple of young stock, three year old and a yearling",then it it is very much a family interest
but,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,I 'm not going to worry,"if I don't win, as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself For me that 's the main thing"
and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"I think so, yes I m not, not really highly competitive at all you know I just enjoy working with them And uhm, well I wouldn't like you to think I didn't try my best I love things to be done well properly","but I 'm not going to worry if I don't win, as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself For me that 's the main thing"
because,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,You stay in,it 's raining You stay here and I 'll bring her down to you
then,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,"And a teacher, and what","was it that was, within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself evident"

so,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,And her just off the grass yes I don't know what it is,it 's I suppose it 's ideal for you here is it

and,P1B-041_Clerical_Habits,And what had you thought to do,Oh yes well I 'd thought of doing either French or music as I say I just don't know why I ended up doing theology but I did I don't think anybody suggested it to me I presume it was just

so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,they 'll need me,I 'll be friends with them
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,I 've smelled Emporio for women,it 's not very nice
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,we were just walking by the lifts anyway,it was just like
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces,if I was going to be stuck there
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"You 're not meant to know it but, they do sometimes like if you got, like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who, like she was a student there",she was over from Ireland
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is, imagine if you appealed then",the result came back worse
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"No, cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result I 'd just be like, and they 'd go back over it with a, even more so, cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like, what, five minutes or something like that","Yeah Yeah I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for, extra marks they can give you, not looking for"
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do,you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term
then,P1A-100_Trinity_students,One of my study incentives,"And is it like, are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
if,P1A-100_Trinity_students,that 's,I get in at all
once,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"Oh yeah, now I remember No see","when I was in a lift with my brother, we were in James 's hospital right"
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,I can't remember why we were going up the lift,we went up the lift I was
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,we were going up to the second floor,we were down in the basement
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,you Ah,much fun throwing out notes I just went into a note-cleaning frenzy the other day
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,One of my study incentives,"then is it like, are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well"
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,It really is And you wonder why I 'm the bitter middle child,Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter I mean it couldn't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy I didn't know what it was Or just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"No, cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result I 'd just be like","they 'd go back over it with a, even more so, cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like, what, five minutes or something like that"
if,P1A-100_Trinity_students,they do sometimes like,you got
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Can it not just be any subject or,"Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it but, they do sometimes like if you got, like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who, like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland like they wanted As in like, biology and chemistry and maths or something, and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she, they let her in anyway"
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,And in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves it was really slow and depressing and horrible,Yeah they might
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,It 's really horrible,It really is you wonder why I 'm the bitter middle child
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"he did that like, and he was just like",he was in the lift by himself earlier
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Oh right,"like you can, you have both options there anyway so"
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"and you can kind of, it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself and going down to the canteen in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term",It looks pretty good
then,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"Uh it 's fairly good, it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share, everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years",You pay every year
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Yeah Hopefully Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I don't like,"sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is, imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse"
while,P1A-100_Trinity_students,And he opened the doors,the lift was going down
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,It 's like clown music It 's awful And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched,"every few seconds it 's interrupted by, welcome to Specsavers Your call is important to us"
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,he did that like,he was just like
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"Yeah And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat, because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole year","I think you share a kitchen with three other people, which is the least anywhere else would have you Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people"
although,P1A-100_Trinity_students,No but No but so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well,I 've never had to ring them
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,That that that also annoys me actually yeah,when your sister gets there they 're just going to call her Female Rasho
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there,"there 's, there 's something I was going to say I can't remember now"
or,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Yeah That wouldn't be nice at all really how,about Emporio for women Is that nice
but,P1A-100_Trinity_students,You didn't sit my exams,you 're Judith You 're smart
if,P1A-100_Trinity_students,like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces but,I was going to be stuck there
when,P1A-100_Trinity_students,So they 're just going to call her Female Rasho,your sister gets there
when,P1A-100_Trinity_students,you could do,"you were stuck in a lift, like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
because,P1A-100_Trinity_students,it couldn't have been because of his laziness,you 're just as lazy
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,It looks pretty good it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term,you can kind of
also,P1A-100_Trinity_students,That actually yeah,that that annoys me
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"Fingers crossed Yeah so, so hopefully just the three people are alright",they 're not
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Mm,"you need what, you need one A and four Bs"
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people,they upgraded a few thousand I think so
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Ah That 's like something my brother would do,"it was just like, then the thing, the lift stopped and it was just like, oh no we 're stuck, we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like, and he was just there oh Jesus I can't even close them"
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,"Uhm, some of them are ensuite You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served",fingers crossed for me
and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,School 's over,it 's destroyed you Ah so much fun throwing out notes I just went into a note-cleaning frenzy the other day

and,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift,"they start drinking coffee I mean wouldn't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift, like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon"
then,P1A-100_Trinity_students,No,It 's like clown music It 's awful And if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched
so,P1A-100_Trinity_students,Uh,"it 's, like they, you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay and there 's a room, like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so"

but,P1A-100_College_plans,"No, cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result I 'd just be like, and they 'd go back over it with a, even more so, cos like realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like, what, five minutes or something like that","Yeah Yeah I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for, extra marks they can give you, not looking for"
and,P1A-100_College_plans,in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do,you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term

then,P1A-100_College_plans,"Uh it 's fairly good, it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share, everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years",You pay every year

then,P1A-097_Sisters_2,He is To hang onto him to do the Junior Cert,"kind of, at least til he gets over that reasonably you know It would be some job you know"
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"I certainly would worry about you know, he 's bad enough as he is and he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out","It is a bit much And I certainly would worry about you know, he 's bad enough as he is and he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out"
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know",he 's going to say no
or,P1A-097_Sisters_2,you 'll get AIDS or something,you have to go somewhere hygienic

as,P1A-097_Sisters_2,My waistline has gone completely,I said I 'm eating too much
when,P1A-097_Sisters_2,it 'll be good,it 's done
so,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I 'm bigger than you and this kind of thing,"anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry and all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as bedamned you little shite"
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I see I see,But real aggressive Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope And I thought I 'd like my frigging job sweetie giving you your twenty-five p I said no you can use your own money And then he marched into

though,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"I 've kind of believe it, it just feels like that tonight Even",the sky is very clear it just has that really cold feeling
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I would 've thought he would 've been concerned,Yeah it 's a different kind of scene to the the drink you know I don't think he
until,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah Yeah yeah,you kind of feel they have to be a bit responsible for themselves
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"about you know, he 's bad enough as he is",he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out

as,P1A-097_Sisters_2,it 's as sore,bedamned you little shite
then,P1A-097_Sisters_2,this morning he,he starts saying to me
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I see I see,But real aggressive Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope I thought I 'd like my frigging job sweetie giving you your twenty-five p And I said no you can use your own money And then he marched into
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"But uhm, he just, got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths Now when you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off",everyone is fucking freezing
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,you know you have to be careful,that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah at fourteen it 's just not on Not on,So anyway but he was like a devil yesterday Then he announced yesterday he said I 'm going into town to get my ear pierced I said you are in your bum going into town to get your ear pierced Where are you going And he said oh this place in Nemo 's Arcade And I said you have to go somewhere hygienic or you 'll get AIDS or something
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult, and cheeky and that But this kind of, look now that really makes you just boil, with rage you know","Really kind of trying it out you know I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know and he 's going to say no And then what do you do And that you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it, you know"
when,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"But uhm, he just, got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths Now and everyone is fucking freezing",you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off
but,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I see I see,real aggressive Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope And I thought I 'd like my frigging job sweetie giving you your twenty-five p And I said no you can use your own money And then he marched into
also,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah Yeah yeah,And I mean in the cold everybody eats more You have to
when,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah I mean it 's too dangerous,you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"Too young yeah yeah Mm, would he not be afraid of that","And Ben said something and he, and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to you, in this tone I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I wasn't speaking to you"
while,P1A-097_Sisters_2,So I said get up that stairs So after a,he called Ben out and said I 'm sorry It 's just blah blah blah So anyway I said
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"So anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry","all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as bedamned you little shite"
so,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"So anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me and he said he was sorry and all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that So in the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as bedamned you little shite",I came out to the bottom of the stairs
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,I hope it 's real sore,"Yeah, yeah what do you do then yeah Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah Mm Mm mm just one is it"
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,e,"Yeah and the night that this 'd happened he had brought, the, one of the fellas back to stay in Mike 's house Mike was saying oh yeah I 'd like to have these parents coming down to me and all this kind of thing you know"
then,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult, and cheeky and that But this kind of, look now that really makes you just boil, with rage you know","Really kind of trying it out you know And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know and he 's going to say no And what do you do And that you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it, you know"
then,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah yeah Yeah that was for today was it Oh,Yeah he marched into me today saying can I have my pocket money Like he gets
and,P1A-097_Sisters_2,"Too young yeah yeah Mm, would he not be afraid of that","Ben said something and he, and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to you, in this tone And I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him really viciously I wasn't speaking to you"
but,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah yeah Yeah does really Bitter,"anyway he was just the face of him now would just stop a clock you know cos he can't have his bath Like he 's in there every, at least every second day, you know"
but,P1A-097_Sisters_2,feel uncomfortable,I
but,P1A-097_Sisters_2,Yeah anyway I said uhm,it 's kind of getting to the point where I 'll say that and he 's going to say no and then you 'll think what the hell do you do then
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies, what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one","Though I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say, let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland,in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists
as,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"it is after all the duty of garrison people by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",they have
when,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,to rediscover their identity as a community church,I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair",it 's got to be heard
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,They 're crumbling now in front of a world which is changing rapidly,the ideologues of both camps aren't prepared to accept that
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,We know how dangerous that is,at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,They were constructed precisely in order not to live with one another,they were constructed precisely in order to have one group dominate over another
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around, the Catholic story and the Protestant story",you talk about prophetic voice
when,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,important uhm,people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group
as,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,the Methodist Conference is currently meeting in Dublin One of the issues discussed on Friday concerned the role of Methodist societies in the local community,we pointed out at the beginning of the programme
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination,that 's its purpose I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation",which won't do it for us
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that,it isn't quite like that
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,that do when it comes to looking at memory,how memory is used in telling a story
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it, it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision",uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive
if,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,uhm both these ideologies,"we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"I 'm just wondering whether that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland because, in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists, are no longer dominant in any real sense uh they don't have any control over, political power It 's it 's direct rule from Westminster",they don't have any
so,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine"
also,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it, it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision",And uhm I think uh this is true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story, which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions therefore we have the right to call the tune","my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies, what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one"
if,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And they won't get through that stage,we won't listen to them now to the dominating group
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"the IRA does either I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they","I 'm not sure however that the IRA does either I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they"
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,But it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,a very good question is a division isn't it,I think what we 're seeing at the moment
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive,"has Catholic Nationalism any part to play for example in the struggle that is taking place in Northern Ireland today I mean what, uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism when they have their vision of a united Ireland"
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"that in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this","uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future"
so,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of, civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for, uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace, but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king","are you actually saying uh in a sense that uh the stories, the two stories one Protestant the other Catholic Nationalist one Protestant Loyalist, they 're actually crumbling"
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"But you can't do it You must listen Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard","as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling"
so,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment",I take your point entirely
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,because I think the uh IRA and the INLA,"uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they"
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group,I 've called them those
however,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on But we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman",And it is important always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Now, it 's not always going to be a nice experience to do so",you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that
if then,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",you 're going to dominate them you don't try to win them over as friends
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment",They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"I think that, that the Catholic Church, faced with the fact that it is losing ground, uhm is I would say reprehensibly accepting patronage uh from government sources",there is a strong anti-clericalism Uh they 're being used in other words to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"They 'll say that 's our vision We want, to to maintain the link with Britain",we want to maintain our Protestant ethos
as,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling",they see it
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us",the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that,"you can't do it You must listen Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard"
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this",Yeah I m not saying that I do
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer, uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism","I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us"
therefore,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance,"Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story, which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions we have the right to call the tune"
though,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another,I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those And that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it",uh uh that 's fine
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"It 's not a question of giving them uh equal respect, as is often said by well-meaning people, but rather to try and transcend these two uh mutually exclusive ideologies",that must be an extremely difficult thing to do
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine",it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast
when,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"what, uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism",they have their vision of a united Ireland
in other words,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And there is a strong anti-clericalism Uh they 're being used,to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Well I think it is that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination, and that 's its purpose I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell, it 's the use to which they put the story",the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance
if,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,whose usefulness to their masters is over,we may put it like that without offensiveness
as,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,they listen to their own story uh,it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group
in fact,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that,"Yeah I m not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,You must listen,"uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not, always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard"
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say,that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people",if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Yes yes I actually tried to talk about that in in this book right that it it must be taken uh uh on board by people particularly the establishment let us say in Dublin, uh that the Unionist people, are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over","it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have, by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,they should not win friends and influence people,you 've got to dominate people
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,But I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire,"uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of, civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for, uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace, but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king"
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,what they say,it 's not
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,So I take your point entirely,that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill and Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous, light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future",you must be sacrificed uh to this
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities,uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community
when,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,that do,it comes to looking at memory
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,And that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill,Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for",that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"In the same way men may talk about the, the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on But we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman",it is important however always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling","if we won't listen to them now to the dominating group, they won't get through that stage"
or,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group,uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features,a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now
and,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true,"uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine"
because,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,it is told by the other group,it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group
therefore,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Now their usefulness, in terms of the old imperial structures, is over That 's finished That story is finished","They are feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment"
if,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,you 're going,you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,Yeah,I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it
but,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Now the British Empire has disappeared I think there are great forces that uhm are undermining the possibility of the future for all our children, in this island",I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire
as,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"And another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling",we do listen to one
however,P1B-043_Sunday_Sequence_2,"Now uhm I think that uhm, the the Catholic Nationalism represented by the official Church organs in say let us say West Belfast has no particular vision for the future","Uh I 'm not sure that the IRA does either because I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they they are behaving as though the enemy uhm of us all is the British Empire"
if,P1A-095_Strep_infection,been better,he had 've just buggered off back to Belfast
when,P1A-095_Strep_infection,they told me,"I was over the last time and, oh"
but,P1A-095_Strep_infection,I know It would 've been better if he had 've just buggered off back to Belfast,"Exactly It 's on your own doorstep like she 's saying she 's apparently she 's Catherine her son who 's twenty-one, came back from Slane really really bad sore throat Streptococci infection his throat 'd closed up Took him to Moy clinic on"
later,P1A-095_Strep_infection,I came home and uh,See you babe
and,P1A-095_Strep_infection,"Conor and Estelle especially Estelle 2 sylls they told me when I was over the last time and, oh",I know what 's the story with them Are they still separated
so,P1A-095_Strep_infection,So uhm,Uh uh hold on 4 sylls Think my mobile 's about to go Ah it 's only John Alright how was your day
then,P1A-095_Strep_infection,She 's only,staying for one night and going back to going down to Armagh cos her friend 's getting married
so,P1A-095_Strep_infection,Well even at the end of the day half the photographs were shit anyway,You know what I mean It 's only the odd one that you might want to get developed
then,P1A-095_Strep_infection,"Just me and Don Well we 'd usually watch Will and Grace but the series is over, on Living So it was double bill last week so we had it on nine to ten and then the Teachers and 2 sylls Oh well What happened",a video couple of bottles of wine and an oul chat 2 sylls So I didn't come back here now until it was after six before I got sitting down and having a spliff And well I was getting up cos Mummy was on the phone so She was saying about uh Jamie and her being

if,P1A-095_Strep_infection,like uh no Uhm and he sat for a minute and he goes there 's several reasons,"she was coming back But uhm I just uh chanced me arm and uhm, asked him could I go, to be off tomorrow And he was like"
so,P1A-095_Strep_infection,No you see we 've our meetings on a Thursday,"I think he must be having a, an announcement or something"
when,P1A-095_Strep_infection,Anthony and Very cool I 'll get them developed somewhere good this time,youse didn't know they were being taken you know Trying to get some good candid shots

but,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"that, perhaps they haven't turned away from God",society has turned away from them
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,what he 's saying,that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to

and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God,"that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do, we as a church must get alongside those who have this tendency as we must get alongside those who are, uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with or that they have eventually found within themselves and fight that tendency"

and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"different things happening on a farm animals being born and so forth And there 's a wholesomeness of attitude to nature and to sex and to all that sort of thing and the family unit And very very often in the country you still find uh the vestiges of family worship and family discipline, and indeed family fun They go off for the day together as a family And of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country There 's a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller and the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of","they get a interest into and a and a an insight into, uh, sex to be quite blunt, through just living on the farm and seeing the animals and so forth being born"
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations,"as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values, we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right"
yet,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship",And you 've got a wonderful sense of humour
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God,"the right ways of living Righteousness says the Bible, exalteth a nation but sin, is a disgrace to any people"
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"I 'm trying to point the Church and the people that they will I hope uh in some way or other influence back to the basic principles of good wholesome living, not a censorious business at all but rather here 's the right way to live God made us, he redeemed us by his son and here 's the way to live",I don't want to be seen to be censoring people God leaves out for us clear rules for good wholesome living
but,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,And yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour,"some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your theme, of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship"
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"Is that because people see the Church, as a club, a social club",I 'm afraid to say that many cases they do that 's just a sad business if they do because it 's not It 's the gathering of God 's people together and it 's a matter of them going out with the message that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God and that as the result of it being pleasing to God will be wholesome and happy for them
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"if you can inject a little humour, without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off",perhaps it does help to to to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I
or,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,"as we must get alongside those who are, uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with",that they have eventually found within themselves
because,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,Is that,"people see the Church, as a club, a social club"
and,P1B-042_Sunday_Sequence_1,of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country There 's a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller,the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of
but,P1A-099_Dresses,Uhm,I don't know what to wear with it

or,P1A-099_Dresses,Mm,could Martin
but,P1A-099_Dresses,Well we could then,we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad We 'd be friendlier with her
and,P1A-099_Dresses,Fintan rang me actually right after uhm I put down the phone to you Remember that night,"He was like, you have to come You have to come I was like, no I can't"
and,P1A-099_Dresses,it 'll fit you,I 'm like no no I want it to be big

and,P1A-099_Dresses,Very good Are you looking forward to it,then if we can get Declan Neill and them to come on it 'd be grand
then,P1A-099_Dresses,Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that I think that 's including Fintan if we can get him to come but we probably won't be able to,And it 's like you know we 're trying to get them on
otherwise,P1A-099_Dresses,Why,Well cos you know like I mean good fitting on me I don't want it to be too small
but,P1A-099_Dresses,Uhm no it 's not it 's uhm Charles as well and that I think that 's including Fintan if we can get him to come,we probably won't be able to
though,P1A-099_Dresses,Back to the old days,Yeah I think we 'll end up going to Declan 's
besides,P1A-099_Dresses,And I That was the last resort,don't want to ring Martin
and,P1A-099_Dresses,Yeah He called in,I was like make sure you ring Hilary
and,P1A-099_Dresses,it 's uhm Charles as well,that I think that 's including Fintan
and,P1B-046_Elections,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
if,P1B-046_Elections,"the new government have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio","they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage"
if,P1B-046_Elections,"be removed and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position",they 're not doing the job
if,P1B-046_Elections,"Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but",the trust is not there from the start
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair",he 's been very fair to all sides
if then,P1B-046_Elections,"the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down",the government won't survive Certainly
and,P1B-046_Elections,"And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio","the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person"
but,P1B-046_Elections,Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers while Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition,how long will that state of affairs continue
and,P1B-046_Elections,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds And I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"You only bring those people together if we are conscious, of their concerns",if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen
if,P1B-046_Elections,"because he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours",they did
but,P1B-046_Elections,by,I thought the experience certainly was an interesting one I. I 've said to people I learned more in the last two weeks than I 've perhaps possibly learnt in my previous seventeen years in Leinster House
if,P1B-046_Elections,Uh,you just take the allocation of portfolios for example
as,P1B-046_Elections,"that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem",I said earlier
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet And as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending",that certainly doesn't indicate to me that Fine Gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party
and,P1B-046_Elections,"they seem to want to avoid dealing with that And because of the amount of fudge on, crucial issues, local charges, and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem",I think from the programme for government it 's clear the government don't understand that
because,P1B-046_Elections,previously uhm would lose child support,they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh
but,P1B-046_Elections,"I think Prionsias De Rossa and John Bruton have worked well in opposition, uh so I don't see that as a problem",I don't
and,P1B-046_Elections,"the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down",once it did everything else collapsed
and,P1B-046_Elections,I hope it 's not going to continue,I certainly think it 's very unfair on the new government In a period
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Well as we saw at the break of the last government, obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems",I think that may well be the case with this government too
but,P1B-046_Elections,on,joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader
so,P1B-046_Elections,uh,I don't see that as a problem
and,P1B-046_Elections,And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen,"I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds And I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair, and he 's been very fair to all sides","if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position And I hope that the government won't proceed with that And certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Northern Ireland policy, they 've control over broadcasting",they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum
previously,P1B-046_Elections,a lot of people,who uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh
if,P1B-046_Elections,"And And I hope that the government won't proceed with that And certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats","somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position"
and,P1B-046_Elections,We 'll be returning to the Peace Process a bit later on but joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader,"the new Minister for Social Welfare Prionsias de Rossa First of all, congratulations on your new appointment It 's uh it 's a high-spending department"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"they seem to want to avoid dealing with that And because of the amount of fudge on, crucial issues, local charges","I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem"
because,P1B-046_Elections,I supported the nominee of Fine Gael in the last occasion,I think it 's important that the opposition has that position Until recent years the opposition always had that position
because,P1B-046_Elections,Or it won't really exist but if the trust is not there from the start,"to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"uh, ever ever ever achieved",that is in relation to child
because,P1B-046_Elections,"Peter Sutherland, earlier this year","if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours"
therefore,P1B-046_Elections,"the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person","And I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"that a lot of people who, previously uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh will no longer do so","it will eliminate a lot of uhm, poverty traps It"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person",I don't know if they could be certain of that and I think they need to be very careful It 's not a question of putting in our own
and,P1B-046_Elections,"I think, the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government",it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment
because,P1B-046_Elections,We have to we have to have competitive state enterprises able to compete in the market,"of our membership of EU, we have to be responsible"
because,P1B-046_Elections,This is a period of uncertainty,we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts
and,P1B-046_Elections,"I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission","therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person"
if then,P1B-046_Elections,to do,that I think we 're going to cause further problems Already
or,P1B-046_Elections,it won't really exist but if the trust is not there from the start,"because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation"
if,P1B-046_Elections,certainly they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats,they do
if,P1B-046_Elections,to cause big problems for John Bruton,the architect of the process is standing behind at him shouting from the sidelines uh
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Uhm I was very disappointed with the way he handled the negotiations for the formation of government, despite the fact that Fine Gael had fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party the Labour Party seemed to call all the shots","Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending"

if,P1B-046_Elections,to destroy the process,he continues speaking like this
and,P1B-046_Elections,"I don't believe it is I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party, it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party","I see very little evidence, of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"we 're talking about personal, personal relationships being very very important How do you think Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on",This is the first inter-party government for for forty years
and,P1B-046_Elections,"He must be aware, of the need for, sensitivity","Albert Reynolds himself was very concerned just over a year ago when a very important document was leaked to a journalist he expressed that concern The problem we have in Northern Ireland is that, we 've, two divided, communities a divided people"
and,P1B-046_Elections,"Well I 've already said that those comments were, unwise and insensitive",I repeat that I was very surprised
and,P1B-046_Elections,"In relation to Padraig Flynn, the personality of the Commissioner is not the issue","I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission"
if,P1B-046_Elections,it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept,you take the attitude to state enterprise
once,P1B-046_Elections,"to work together as a team the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down and",it did everything else collapsed
also,P1B-046_Elections,One issue they 'll have to resolve quite quickly is the position of the European Commissioner and,the Leas Ceann Comhairle
and,P1B-046_Elections,if they 're not doing the job,uhm being removed from that position
and,P1B-046_Elections,"This is a period of uncertainty because we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts I 've given my assurance and that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support, what they do",I hope that Fianna Fa/il do likewise
if,P1B-046_Elections,I think,you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party
as,P1B-046_Elections,Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending,I said
so that,P1A-094_Health,Uh-huh,"s that, no that 's this year over like and so I 've, nothing again now The end of September it starts again"
so,P1A-094_Health,Yeah,yeah I was well pleased
but,P1A-094_Health,"Yeah yeah shattering, several sylls",you know So listen enough of me What about you What 's been happening
so,P1A-094_Health,Yeah they 're scattering it with uh injections Uh,uh it 's uh they say almost back to normal now And uhm yeah he 's he 's but he 's he was in good form when I left you know And I think Mum was glad Lisa and I were up for the company And Lisa distracts her uhm

finally,P1A-094_Health,Hi How are you,caught each other yeah
then,P1A-094_Health,Mad stuff,And uhm so the babysitter 's going to mind Lisa when you 're down there
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs,Yeah career-wise it was shaping up well for you then
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Just to explain to people he was the Irish scout who had sent over all the Irish players in those years,"That 's right That 's right sent over all those Irish players then at the time I remember uhm it was based on his word really that I think Dave Sexton turned around and went, that 'll do he 'll do for us"
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I went over for the trial
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"because when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Mm,You know his word was that well respected by Manchester United
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,that 's,I wanted to go away to Manchester United
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as well Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs,when am I going to come back for the Dubs
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,as well Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs and,am I going to come back for the Dubs
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,That 's right yeah That 's right Covering every blade of grass,uhm That
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on",after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Listen tell us this about uh when this long-haired fella arrived out to training first None of you knew knew him well Jimmy,"No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty and he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they"
so that,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it So I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days",helped enormously and then after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
as soon as,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,there was no sort of watering period with him,he came into the team
later,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,,"A household name in, in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry A couple of years sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad and today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are"
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"uh, reshown",often I mean you missed it but it 's they keep reshowing it
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But you know,you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen"
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Moran coming into the team,you were All-Ireland champions You wouldn't have known a lot about him sure you wouldn't
because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,amazed me you know,I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were
as,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,to come back for the Dubs I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but,you say they just uh
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Yeah,who 's a big soccer fan as well Hello Mike
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD,I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin",I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked he screwed her off a wee bit You know,one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked he screwed her off a wee bit You know
because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"uh, the move to Manchester United were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time",you were
after,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and",massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,us this about uh,this long-haired fella arrived out to training first None of you knew knew him well Jimmy
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually it 's only like two or three years really,I look back on it
because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I know,I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break
because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,the soccer career went on and on,I think I always wanted to come back for the Dubs I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but as you say they just uh
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career,you go around Ireland
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,That must have been strange,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days"
when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I think,I was about seventeen
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Mike 's still on the line there That was uh there was huge hype in in the country in those days wasn't there,"Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it We enjoyed the games We won some and we lost some I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads, and vice versa with them"
then,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs,Yeah And career-wise it was shaping up well for you
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,We won some,we lost some
if,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,he would,he 'd kicked it normally
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less,you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two
if,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match,you hadn't
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers",like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Yeah,uh I remember that now I played mid-field I think
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks,I said I couldn't do it
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,That must have been strange,"Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it So I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days"
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,That 's right yeah I know,"Des sorry but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball"
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"It was never a Honda fifty by the by the way It was a Honda ninety, 3 sylls You wouldn't know how to get onto onto one of them now",you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty","he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they"
because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,It was,"when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know"
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it,he drop-kicked
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"I always remember the skill factor in them was, amazed me you know because I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were",how many of those other fellas made it
if,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"Oh, you 'd be lucky","you 're talking about one, two"
whereas,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,all year round,most of the other players would have been on their winter break
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,A youth team Yeah,"There 'd be a, maybe a few reserve team players in it as well plus youth team players it was kind of like a very young team and that but very"
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself,I 've got to give it a try I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well if you were watching that particular game,Mm you came back over and it was kind of a secret at first wasn't it about you
if,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well,you were watching that particular game
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself,I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs
though,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And you were a fairly close-knit team,Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team
as if,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,it 's only like two or three years really,I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,so often I mean you missed it,it 's they keep reshowing it
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over,I just said to myself
so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Yeah that 's right that 's right,the least I could have done was to run around the place
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,The Dubs were actually going so well at the time,I 'd no real interest You know I think when I was about seventeen
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,No I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it it 's only like two or three years really,"when you go around Ireland, rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career"
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,after,little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Yeah,at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,No there was a game They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that,which team was it The first team or the reserves
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,So you came back over,it was kind of a secret at first
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage,we were all fairly seasoned footballers
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,Not initially anyway but,"I remember actually seeing him uh in Tralee sometime He played a played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say, early seventy-six probably you know and I remember I was resting I said I was injured but, we usually took breaks in those days during the winter I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September and a few other years you know"
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"A household name in, in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry A couple of years later, sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad",today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are
as,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I was treated the same and that And uhm,them Yeah
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,But Des sorry ve drop-kicked that ball,"that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't"
then,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,And uhm That,I know because I couldn't catch balls I had to run around the place you see I fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break

then,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,So that helped enormously and,after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract And
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm,as you say they just uh
but,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,"No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen","Hanahoe, and myself to get on with the training and like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day I think it 's something we all appreciated He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team"
and,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,what he was going to do to us the following September,a few other years you
and,P1A-098_Bad_weather,Yeah wouldn't couldn't be fucking arsed I think going out in it,it 's fucking minging I really would
and,P1A-098_Bad_weather,Well Eithne 's been away in Spain,"so I don't really like being, out sitting in the house on my own, cos once you get out there, it 's it 's a case of you 're stuck there for the night You wouldn't even go to the shop, cos it 's too dangerous to even walk up the Antrim Road"
so,P1A-098_Bad_weather,Yeah might see what the craic is tomorrow maybe,Seanie was saying as well So
then,P1A-098_Bad_weather,o,So 're you just back up from Donegal
so,P1A-098_Bad_weather,I 'm changing wards,I should have an extra bit of cash coming in anyway
then,P1A-098_Bad_weather,It 'd more than likely be an all-night affair But then I have to be back in Belfast for ten in the morning,Ah Right Well I 'm off the next day you see I 'd probably end up working that Saturday and Sunday maybe or Saturday anyway So
and,P1A-098_Bad_weather,"You know you 're so stuck in a rut and, the bills coming in",it 's even worse
once,P1A-098_Bad_weather,"And, so I don't really like being, out sitting in the house on my own, cos it 's it 's a case of you 're stuck there for the night You wouldn't even go to the shop, cos it 's too dangerous to even walk up the Antrim Road",you get out there
if,P1A-098_Bad_weather,me and Mary were saying,we go out

when,P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,Well you know,you really come up against it
when,P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,"he doesn't quite know what he 's going to, do He hopes, that he, starts off very simply, and hopes that he can elaborate","he starts off, with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas"

so,P1B-049_M_O_Suilleabhain,American influences in your music at least,it seems to me
or,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,"religiously whereas if you go to other areas like the Shankill or other areas there 's a we 've got that sort of Protestant individualism And uhm I I. I see enormous strides being made in other areas, tremendous funds being poured into other areas and quite rightly so too And it seemed to me that perhaps we weren't getting our act together And that we should look for uhm uh expertise people like maybe solicitors and bankers and trade unionists and community workers and retired civil servants other people like that who might be help help us and help clergy and parishes uh in formulating schemes and Yeah I 'm afraid I my my appeal didn't meet with any great uh response Perhaps uh it 's just uh that we are indifferent",perhaps it 's the difficulty getting people to own an idea Maybe
if,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,"you uh deliver an attack on obscenity, nudity, pornography, lack of privacy but don't",I may so describe it You
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,that and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end,but we must sort of think things through
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,So you you think that there there has to be a reconstruction as it were of moral values in the community,"No I think the moral values are there but the facts are that, uhm uh so much has been happening in the community uhm through things like uhm uhm much more of uhm uh use of video and and film and so forth, uh and the cashing in on obscenity I think that uh the film industry for years was in in some decline and now has uh through through the use of way-out producers have now begun to uhm uh produce, uhm films uh which have been condemned by a large circle of people I mean Lord Rees-Mogg recently uhm sounded criticism of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's uh Terminator films And so many other films too seem to highlight violence I mean you 've only got to go to Silence of the Lambs and so forth people are beginning to I think see that the whole swing of the pendulum has gone far too far, and that that it begets violence"
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,You must be aware of that stream of thinking,"There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they, they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth uhm"
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,Yes but but your comments about Protestant disadvantage and the need for uh support both financial and skilled echo the views of uh a man I interviewed the other day former UDA man Glen Barr You were were at one with his views on this one,"Yes, yes indeed I would be Indeed I would be I believe that there 's tremendous goodwill out there There I believe I 'm sure there 's goodwill in the government I 'm sure there 's goodwill in in forms like the, the the Ireland Fund Uh all sorts of other, funds have got to be tapped And I 'm I was delighted uh on to see on on yesterday 's paper that uhm there 's another uh substantial sum of money being pumped into making Belfast work Already a hundred and twenty-four million has been pumped in uhm to to various areas and I 'm delighted that but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end"
when,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,Yeah well I Yeah No I think that I wouldn't ah I think that certainly it can be called sin certainly but there 's also a question that people are are are uh find themselves with these genes in their bodies and so forth and they 've got to learn to live with it It,"s only it 's uh it 's only when it is uhm used wrongly People cannot alter their genes They can't alter their balance and so forth I wouldn't want to go down that road too far but that wasn't, that wasn't the area which I was, dealing with in my address"
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,Now perhaps uh the feeling is or the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities Maybe that 's the reason,"Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, uh I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment"
and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,"Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say And it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, uh I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment","Now you you mentioned this uh Roman Catholic community and the, cohesion and and the efforts to obtain you mentioned grants going to places like Poleglass the New Lodge I think North Howard Street something in the region of fifteen million pounds uh, you 've been saying that you admire their success I mean I am sure and I accept it is admire and not covet"
but,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,"it 's quite admire I feel that they have got their their their act together And uh look at the scheme in Poleglass valued at five point one million, it it it obviously has, uh involved a lot of people who have got the project right and have thought it out and prepared the whole ground well I 'm quite certain money is there at the government level",you must get your act together
