7,when,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,2140..2144,2140,Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks
8,after,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,2454..2459,2454,So that helped enormously and then after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract

21,because,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,7161..7168,7161,I know because I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see
22,so,P1B-047_Kevin_Moran,7318..7320,7318,so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break.

59,and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,3019..3022,3019,and I accept it is admire and not covet.
60,and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,4307..4310,4307,but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end.
61,and,P1B-044_Bishop_Poyntz,4545..4548,4545,"and and it is this May I put this point to you that uh Protestants perhaps fear, uh that to advance along these lines is to challenge authority and that in some way would diminish loyalty uh to the State and to the Crown"
